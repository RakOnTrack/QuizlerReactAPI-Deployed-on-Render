(consistency in the\ndesign)\n• Set the Margin property to 8, this will add horizontal spacing.\n• Set the PrefWidth and PrefHeight to 'USE_COMPUTED_SIZE’.\n• Set the MaxHeight to 'MAX_VALUE', this will adjust the height\nof VBox to be wide as its needed.\nPans’s properties\n• Reset the Pane’s Pref Width and Pref\nHeight to their default\nUSE_COMPUTED_SIZE values.\n• Set its Max Width and Max Height to\nMAX_VALUE so that it occupies the full\nwidth and height of the BorderPane’s\ncenter area.\n• In the JavaFX CSS category of the\nInspector window’s Properties section,\nclick the field below Style (which is initially\nempty) and select -fx-background-color\nto indicate that you’d like to specify the\nPane’s background color. In the field to\nthe right, specify white.\nTitledPane Layout Container\n• A TitledPane layout container displays a title at its top and is a\ncollapsible panel containing a layout node.\n• This in turn will contains other nodes.\n• We’ll use TitledPanes to organize the app’s RadioButtons and\nto help the user understand the purpose of each RadioButton\ngroup.\nTitledPane Properties\n• Drag two TitledPane (empty) objects onto VBox.\n• Set the first’s TitledPane Text property to Drawing.\n• Set the Second TitledPane Text property to Pen Size.\n• We will use VBox in each of the TitledPane to arrange our\nnodes in them.\n• Drag a VBox and drop it in each TitledPane.\n• Set Spacing property for each VBox to 8.\n• Set PrefWidth and PrefHeight for each VBox to USE_COMPUTED_SIZE**.\n**USE_COMPUTED_SIZE: will have the nodes sized based on the available spacing in the layout.\nRadioButton and ToggleGroup\n• RadioButtons function as mutually exclusive options.\n• You add multiple RadioButtons to a ToggleGroup to ensure\nthat only one RadioButton in a given group is selected at a\ntime.\n• We’ll use JavaFX Scene Builder’s capability for specifying each\nRadioButton’s ToggleGroup in FXML;\n• But one can also create a ToggleGroup in Java, then use a\nRadioButton’s setToggleGroup method to specify its ToggleGroup.\nRadioButton and Properties\n• Drag four RadioButtons onto the VBox for the Drawing Color\nTitledPane.\n• Text properties and fx:ids,\nText fx:id’s\nBlack blackRadioButton\nRed redRadioButton\nGreen greenRadioButton\nBlue blueRadioButton\nRadioButton and Properties\n• Drag three RadioButtons onto the VBox for the Pen Size TitledPane\n• Text properties and fx:ids,\n• Select the blackRadioButton and ensure that its Selected property\nis checked, then do the same for the mediumRadioButton.\nText fx:id’s\nSmall smallRadioButton\nMedium mediumRadioButton\nLarge largeRadioButton\nToggleGroup’s properties for RadioButton’s\n• Select all four RadioButtons in the first TitledPane’s VBox, then\nset the Toggle Group property to colorToggleGroup.\n• Once the FXML file is loaded, a ToggleGroup object by that\nname will be created and these four RadioButtons will be\nassociated with it to ensure that only one is selected at a time.\n• Repeat this step for the three RadioButtons in the second\nTitledPane’s VBox, but set the Toggle Group property to\nsizeToggleGroup.\nTiltedPane properties\n• For each TitledPane, set its Pref Width and Pref Height to\n'USE_COMPUTED_SIZE' so the TitledPanes will be sized based\non their contents.\n• This will eliminate all the extra space and make the design\nneater and cleaner.\nAdding Button’s\n• Add two Buttons below the TitledPanes.\n• Text properties and fx:ids,\n• Set each Button’s Max Width property to MAX_VALUE so that\nthey fill the VBox’s width.\nText fx:id’s\nUndo undoButton\nClear clearButton\nVBox properties\n• We’d like the VBox to be only as wide as it needs to be to\ndisplay the controls in that column.\n• To specify this, select the VBox in the Document window’s\nHierarchy section. Set the properties as follows\n• Set the column’s Min Width and Pref Width to USE_COMPUTED_SIZE\n• Set the Max Width to USE_PREF_SIZE**\n• Reset the Max Height to its default USE_COMPUTED_SIZE value.\n**USE_PREF_SIZE : Indicates that the maximum width should be\nthe preferred width\nController Class\n• JavaFX FXML app, the app’s controller class typically defines\ninstance variables for interacting with controls\nprogrammatically, as well as event-handling methods.\n• To ensure that an object of the controller class is created when\nthe app loads the FXML file at runtime, we must specify the\ncontroller class’s name in the FXML file:\n• Expand Scene Builder’s Controller window (located below the\nHierarchy window).\n• In the Controller Class field, type PainterController.\nEvent-Handler Methods Names\n• For the drawingAreaPane, specify drawingAreaMouseDragged as the On Mouse\nDragged event handler.\n• This method will draw a circle in the specified color and size for each mousedragged event.\n• For the four Drawing Color RadioButtons (Select all the RadioButton’s), specify\ncolorRadioButtonSelected as each RadioButton’s On Action event handler.\n• This method will set the current drawing color, based on the user’s selection.\n• For the three Pen Size RadioButtons (Select all the RadioButton’s), specify\nsizeRadioButtonSelected as each RadioButton’s On Action event handler.\n• This method will set the current pen size, based on the user’s selection.\n• For the Undo Button, specify undoButtonPressed as the On Action event handler.\n• This method will remove the last circle the user drew on the screen.\n• For the Clear Button, specify clearButtonPressed as the On Action event handler.\n• This method will clear the entire drawing.\nGenerating FXML Controller Class Methods\n• Scene Builder generates the initial controller-class skeleton as well\n• Select\nView > Show Sample Controller Skeleton.\n• You can copy this code into a PainterController.java file and store the\nfile in the same folder as Painter.fxml\nMain.java\npackage PainterApplication;\nimport javafx.application.Application;\nimport javafx.fxml.FXMLLoader;\nimport javafx.scene.Parent;\nimport javafx.scene.Scene;\nimport javafx.stage.Stage;\npublic class Main extends Application {\n@Override\npublic void start(Stage primaryStage) {\ntry {\nParent root =\nFXMLLoader.load(getClass().getResource(\"Painter.fxml\"));\nScene scene = new Scene(root);\nprimaryStage.setTitle(\"Painter\");\nprimaryStage.setScene(scene);\nprimaryStage.show();\n} catch(Exception e) {\ne.printStackTrace();\n}\n}\npublic static void main(String[] args) { launch(args);

Example\r\npublic interface Pair<K, V>{\r\npublic K getKey();\r\npublic V getValue();\r\n}\r\npublic class OrderedPair<K, V>\r\nimplements Pair<K, V>{\r\nprivate K key;\r\nprivate V value;\r\npublic OrderedPair(K key, V\r\nvalue){\r\nthis.key = key;\r\nthis.value = value;\r\n}\r\npublic K getKey() {return key;}\r\npublic V getValue() {return\r\nvalue;} }\r\n• Instasiation of the OrderedPair class\r\nOrderedPair<String, Integer> p1\r\n= new OrderedPair<>(“One”, 1);\r\nOrderedPair<String, String> p2\r\n= new OrderedPair<>(“Hello”,\r\n“world”);\r\nWhy Generics: Benefits ??\r\nStronger Type checking :\r\n• Fixing Error at run-time or Fixing error at compile time?\r\nList<String> list = new ArrayList<String>();\r\nlist.add(\"hello\");\r\nlist.add(32); //Compile Time Error\r\nCasting can be eliminated:\r\n• No more object types casting.\r\nwith type cast\r\nList list = new ArrayList();\r\nlist.add(\"hello\");\r\nString s = (String) list.get(0);\r\nwithout type case\r\nList <String> list = new ArrayList<String>();\r\nlist.add(“hello”);\r\nString s = list.get(0); //no cast\r\nType Safety:\r\n• Holds only single type of objects, doesn’t allow to store other objects.\r\nNon Generic Example:\r\nimport java.util.*;\r\npublic class ArrayListWithoutGenericsTest {\r\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\r\nList strLst = new ArrayList();\r\nstrLst.add(\"alpha\"); // String upcast to Object implicitly\r\nstrLst.add(\"beta\");\r\nstrLst.add(\"charlie\");\r\nIterator iter = strLst.iterator();\r\nwhile (iter.hasNext()) {\r\n// need to explicitly downcast Object back to String\r\nString str = (String)iter.next();\r\nSystem.out.println(str);\r\n}\r\n// Compiler/runtime cannot detect this error\r\nstrLst.add(Integer.valueOf(1234));\r\n// compile ok, but runtime ClassCastException\r\nString str = (String)strLst.get(3);\r\n}\r\n} We could use an instanceof operator to check for proper type before down-casting.\r\nAgain checking will be done on run-time\r\nGeneric Class (Another Example)\r\nGenericBox.java\r\npublic class GenericBox<E> {\r\nprivate E content; // Private variable\r\npublic GenericBox(E content) {// Constructor\r\nthis.content = content;\r\n}\r\npublic E getContent() {\r\nreturn content;\r\n}\r\npublic void setContent(E content) {\r\nthis.content = content;\r\n}\r\npublic String toString() {\r\nreturn content + \" (\" + content.getClass() + \")\";\r\n} }\r\ntoString() reveals the actual type of the contents\r\npublic class TestGenericBox {\r\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\r\nGenericBox<String> box1 = new GenericBox<>(\"Hello\");\r\n// no explicit downcasting needed\r\nString str = box1.getContent();\r\nSystem.out.println(box1);\r\n// autobox int to Integer\r\nGenericBox<Integer> box2 = new GenericBox<>(123);\r\n// downcast to Integer, autoboxing to int\r\nint i = box2.getContent();\r\nSystem.out.println(box2);\r\n// autobox double to Double\r\nGenericBox<Double> box3 = new GenericBox<>(55.66);\r\n// downcast to Double, autoboxing to double\r\ndouble d = box3.getContent();\r\nSystem.out.println(box3);\r\n}\r\n}\r\nHello (class java.lang.String)\r\n123 (class java.lang.Integer)\r\n55.66 (class java.lang.Double)\r\nType Erasure\r\n• When a generic type is instantiated, the compiler translates those types by a\r\ntechnique called type erasure\r\n• In previous example the compiler replaces all reference to parameterized type E\r\nwith Object, performs the type check, and insert the required downcast\r\noperators.\r\n// A dynamically allocated array with generics\r\npublic class MyGenericArrayList<E> {\r\nprivate int size; // number of elements\r\nprivate Object[] elements;\r\npublic MyGenericArrayList() { // constructor\r\nelements = new Object[10];\r\n}\r\npublic void add(E e) {\r\nif (size < elements.length) {\r\nelements[size] = e;\r\n}\r\nelse { // allocate a larger array and add the element…. }\r\n++size;\r\n}\r\npublic E get(int index) {\r\nif (index >= size) throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException(\"Index: “\r\n+ index + \", Size: \" + size);\r\nreturn (E)elements[index];\r\n}\r\npublic int size() {\r\nreturn size;\r\n}\r\n}\r\npublic class MyGenericArrayListTest {\r\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\r\n// type safe to hold a list of Strings\r\nMyGenericArrayList<String> strLst = new MyGenericArrayList<>();\r\nstrLst.add(\"alpha\"); // compiler checks if argument is of type\r\nString\r\nstrLst.add(\"beta\");\r\nfor (int i = 0; i < strLst.size(); ++i) {\r\n// compiler inserts the downcasting operator (String)\r\nString str = strLst.get(i);\r\nSystem.out.println(str);\r\n}\r\n// compiler detected argument is NOT String, issues compilation\r\nerror\r\nstrLst.add(new Integer(1234));\r\n}\r\n}\r\nRaw Types\r\n• Raw Type is the name of the a generic class or interface without any type arguments. For\r\nexample\r\npublic class Store<T>{\r\npublic void setStore(T t) { /* … */}\r\n// …\r\n}\r\nStore<String> strStore = new Store<>();\r\nStore rawStore = new Store();\r\n• We should avoid raw types. Why?\r\n• They are not type safe, you possibly get runtime error.\r\n• They require proper casting\r\n• They act as normal object instantiation\r\nCreating a parameterized type store\r\nCreating a raw type store\r\nGeneric method\r\n• Type parameters can also be declared within method and constructor signatures to create generic\r\nmethod\r\n• Type parameter's scope is limited to the method in which it is declared.\r\npublic class GenericsMethods {\r\npublic static <T> boolean isEqual(GenericsType<T> g1, GenericsType<T> g2){\r\nreturn g1.get().equals(g2.get()); }\r\npublic static void main(String args[]){\r\nGenericsType<String> g1 = new GenericsType<>();\r\ng1.set(“hello\");\r\nGenericsType<String> g2 = new GenericsType<>();\r\ng2.set(“hello\");\r\nboolean isEqual = GenericsMethods.<String>isEqual(g1, g2);\r\n//above statement can be written simply as\r\nisEqual = GenericsMethods.isEqual(g1, g2);\r\n//without specifying a type between angle brackets.\r\n}\r\n}\r\nRestriction ~ Primitives\r\nType argument cannot be a primitive\r\nStore<int> intStore = new Store<int>();\r\nRestriction ~ Static Context\r\nType argument cannot be used in static context\r\npublic class Device<T>{\r\nprivate static T deviceType;\r\n}\r\nType of static variables:\r\nDevice<Smartphone> phone = new Device<>();\r\nDevice<Pager> pager = new Device<>();\r\nT?

Also, property objects can be bound to one another.\r\n• Binding behavior allows properties to update or synchronize their values based on a changed value from\r\nanother property.\r\n• Among other things, properties let you wire your scene so that the view updates automatically whenever you\r\nmodify the data that sits behind it.\r\n• Properties are observable objects that may be writeable, or read-only.\r\n• There are 30 types of Property object in JavaFX, including the StringProperty, SimpleListProperty and\r\nReadOnlyObjectProperty.\r\n• Each property wraps an existing Java object, adding functionality for listening and binding.\r\n• In addition to the properties functionality, JavaFX provides functionality for binding values through Binding\r\nand Expression objects.\r\n• Binding is a mechanism for enforcing relationships between objects, in which one or more observable\r\nobjects are used to update the value of another object.\r\n• Bindings can act in one, or both directions and can be created either directly from properties (the Fluent API)\r\nor using the Bindings utility class (Bindings API).\r\n• Custom Bindings objects can also be created manually if you need extra customization or performance. This\r\nis called the Low-Level API.\r\n3\r\nTypes of Properties\r\n• Properties and binding are a group of interfaces and classes designed to\r\nmake your life as a developer significantly easier.\r\n• That being said, with 61 properties, and 249 methods in the Bindings\r\nclass, it can get overwhelming and difficult to manage.\r\n• In JavaFX’s Properties API there are two types to be concerned about:\r\n• Read/writable\r\n• Read-only\r\n• In short, JavaFX’s properties are wrapper objects that hold actual values\r\nwhile providing change support, invalidation support, and binding\r\ncapabilities.\r\n• Properties are wrapper objects that have the ability to make values\r\naccessible as read/writable or readonly.\r\n• All wrapper property classes are located in the javafx.beans.property.*\r\npackage namespace.\r\n4\r\nWhat is a\r\nproperty?\r\n• There’s nothing magic under under the bonnet, though.\r\n• Most of the JavaFX Property objects extend two key\r\ninterfaces:\r\n• ReadOnlyProperty<T> and WriteableValue<T>.\r\n• Some of them don’t, though. JavaFX has 10 read-only\r\nproperties, which extend ReadOnlyProperty<T>, but don’t\r\nextend WriteableValue<T>.\r\n5\r\nRead/ Writeable Properties\r\n• Read/writable properties are, as the name suggests, property values that can be both read and modified.\r\n• As an example, let’s look at JavaFX string properties.\r\n• To create a string property that is capable of both readable and writable access to the wrapped value, you\r\nwill use the javafx.beans. property.\r\nStringProperty password = new SimpleStringProperty(\"password1\");\r\npassword.set(\"1234\");\r\nSystem.out.println(\"Modified StringProperty \" + password.get() ); // 1234\r\n• In the case of reading the value back, you would invoke the get() method (or getValue()), which returns the\r\nactual wrapped value(String) to the caller.\r\n• To modify the value, you simply call the set() method (or setValue()) by passing in a string.\r\n6\r\nRead-Only Properties\r\n• To create a property to be read-only, you need to take two steps.\r\n• First, you instantiate a read-only wrapper class.\r\n• Second, invoke the method getReadOnlyProperty() to return a true read-only property object.\r\nReadOnlyStringWrapper userName = new ReadOnlyStringWrapper(\"jamestkirk\");\r\nReadOnlyStringProperty readOnlyUserName = userName.getReadOnlyProperty();\r\n• According to the Javadoc API, the ReadOnlyStringWrapper class “creates two properties that are\r\nsynchronized.\r\n• One property is read-only and can be passed to external users.\r\n• The other property is readable and writable and should be used internally only.\r\n• ” Knowing that the other property can be read and written could allow a malicious developer to cast the\r\nobject to type StringProperty, which then could be modified at will.\r\n• From a security perspective, you should be aware of the proper steps to create a true read-only property.\r\n7\r\nCreating a property\r\n• JavaFX comes with ten in-built classes that make creating a property significantly easier. They implement all\r\nof the required functionality, from listening to binding.\r\n• You can define any of the simple property objects either with or without an initial value. If defined without the\r\ndefault value, they’ll default to the default value of the object the property wraps – 0, false, “” or an empty\r\ncollection.\r\nSimpleIntegerProperty()\r\nSimpleIntegerProperty(int initialValue)\r\n• They can also be created with a name, and an Object that JavaFX refers to as the property’s “bean”. This\r\ndoesn’t encapsulate the property in any way, but creates a symbolic link to an object that represents the\r\nproperty’s “owner”.\r\nSimpleIntegerProperty(Object bean, String name)\r\nSimpleIntegerProperty(Object bean, String name, int initialValue) 8\r\nSimpleBooleanProperty SimpleLongProperty\r\nSimpleDoubleProperty SimpleMapProeprty\r\nSimpleFloatProeprty SimpleObjectProperty\r\nSimlpeIntegerProperty SimpleSetProeprty\r\nSimpleListProperty SimpleStringProperty\r\nCreating a property\r\n• Neither the name nor bean attributes changes the behavior of the property, but it can act as a useful look-up.\r\n• That’s useful if you’re attaching the same listener to multiple properties – especially properties generated\r\nprogrammatically.\r\n• Then, once a change occurs, you can use the bean and name attributes to check which property just\r\nchanged.\r\n• All JavaFX properties have methods to facilitate the following functions:\r\n1. Listening for changes to the property’s value\r\n2. Wring properties together (binding) so that they update automatically\r\n3. Getting and setting (if writable) the property value\r\n9\r\nJavaFX Java Bean: Example\r\nimport javafx.beans.property.*;\r\npublic class User {\r\nprivate final static String USERNAME_PROP_NAME = \"userName\";\r\nprivate final ReadOnlyStringWrapper userName;\r\nprivate final static String PASSWORD_PROP_NAME = \"password\";\r\nprivate final StringProperty password;\r\npublic User() {\r\nuserName = new ReadOnlyStringWrapper(this,\r\nUSERNAME_PROP_NAME, System.getProperty(\"user.name\"));\r\npassword = new SimpleStringProperty(this, PASSWORD_PROP_NAME, \"\");\r\n}\r\npublic final String getUserName() {\r\nreturn userName.get();\r\n}\r\npublic ReadOnlyStringProperty userNameProperty() {\r\nreturn userName.getReadOnlyProperty();\r\n}\r\npublic final String getPassword() {\r\nreturn password.get();\r\n}\r\npublic final void setPassword(String password) {\r\nthis.password.set(password);\r\n}\r\npublic StringProperty passwordProperty() {\r\nreturn password;\r\n}\r\n}\r\n10\r\n• You may notice some obvious differences in the way I\r\ninstantiated the ReadOnlyStringWrapper and\r\nSimpleStringProperty classes.\r\n• Similar to the JavaBean property change support,\r\nJavaFX properties have constructors that will allow\r\nyou to specify the bean itself, its property name, and\r\nits value.\r\nHow to observe the change in a property?\r\n• JavaFX Property objects are a mish-mash of different implemented interfaces.\r\n• Property change support is the ability to add handler code that will respond when a property changes.\r\n• JavaFX property objects contain an addListener() method. This method will accept two types of\r\nfunctional interfaces:\r\n• ChangeListener\r\n• InvalidationListener\r\n• Functional interfaces are single abstract methods that are expressed using the Java lambda syntax.\r\n• All JavaFX properties are descendants of the ObservableValue and Observable interfaces (method\r\noverloading), which provide the addListener() methods for ChangeListener and\r\nInvalidationListener, respectively.\r\n• Finally, remember that it is important to clean up listeners by removing them.\r\n• The purpose of cleaning up listeners is to reclaim memory.\r\n• To remove them, you will invoke the removeListener() method by passing into it a referenced (named)\r\nlistener as opposed to an anonymous inner class or anonymous lambda expression\r\n11\r\nInvalidation Listeners:\r\n• Every property in JavaFX extends the\r\nObservable interface, meaning they all\r\nprovide functionality to register listeners\r\nthat fire when the property invalidates.\r\n• If you’re not familiar with ‘invalidates’, it’s a\r\nway of marking a property as potentially\r\nchanged without forcing it to recalculate\r\nthe property’s value.\r\n• For properties with complex or expensive\r\ncalculations, that can a useful tool, but I\r\ndon’t find they’re used as much as change\r\nlisteners.\r\n12\r\nInvalidation Listeners\r\n• As the property’s value changes, the invalidated () method will be invoked.\r\n• I’ve provided the implementations for both the anonymous inner class and lambda expression-style syntax\r\nfor you to compare.\r\n// Adding a invalidation listener (anonymous inner class)\r\nxProperty.addListener(new InvalidationListener() {\r\n@Override\r\npublic void invalidated(Observable o) {\r\n// code goes here\r\n}\r\n});\r\n// Adding a invalidation listener (lambda expression)\r\nxProperty.addListener((Observable o) -> {\r\n// code goes here\r\n});\r\n13\r\nChange Listeners\r\n• On top of that, JavaFX properties extend ObservableValue<T>, meaning you can register listeners that only fire\r\nwhen an object has actually changed.\r\n• We use these a lot more regularly than invalidation listeners.\r\n• Change listeners allow us to hear a change, and provide executable code ahead of time, which will execute based\r\non the old and new values of the Property.\r\n• Adding a ChangeListener Instance to Respond When the Property Value Changes\r\nSimpleIntegerProperty xProperty = new SimpleIntegerProperty(0);\r\n// Adding a change listener (anonymous inner class)\r\nxProperty.addListener(new ChangeListener<Number>(){\r\n@Override\r\npublic void changed(ObservableValue<? extends Number> ov, Number oldVal,\r\nNumber newVal) {\r\n// code goes here\r\n}\r\n});\r\n// Adding a change listener (lambda expression)\r\nxProperty.addListener((ObservableValue<? extends Number> ov, Number oldVal,\r\nNumber newVal) -> {\r\n// code goes here\r\n}); 14\r\nDifference between Change & Invalidation Listeners\r\n• Using a ChangeListener you will get the Observable (ObservableValue), the old value, and the new value,\r\n• Using the InvalidationListener only gets the Observable object (property).\r\n• The InvalidationListener provides a way to mark values as invalid but does not recompute the value\r\nuntil it is needed.\r\n• This is often used in UI layouts or custom controls, where you can avoid unnecessary computations when\r\nnodes don’t need to be redrawn/repositioned during a layout request or draw cycle.\r\n• When using the ChangeListener, you normally want eager evaluation such as the validation of properties\r\non a form-type application.\r\n• That doesn’t mean you can’t use InvalidationListeners for validation of properties; it just depends on\r\nyour performance requirements and exactly when you need the new value to be recomputed (evaluated).\r\n• When you access the observable value, it causes the InvalidationListener to be eager.\r\n15\r\nBinding\r\n• Binding has the idea of at least two values (properties) being synchronized.\r\n• This means that when a dependent variable changes, the other variable changes.\r\n• JavaFX provides many binding options that enable the developer to synchronize between properties in\r\ndomain objects and GUI controls.\r\n• Properties can be bound natively themselves, as well as by creating Expression and Binding objects.\r\n• Expressions and Bindings are observable objects that also depend on the value of at least one other\r\nobservable object (but potentially more).\r\n• That enables you to create expression chains with multiple calculations: a super-simple way to string together\r\nstring or number conversions.\r\n16\r\nHow to Bind Properties\r\n• Behind the scenes, binding is a specific use-case of change-listening.\r\n• All of JavaFX’s binding APIs have boilerplate code that listens for a change in (at least) one property and uses\r\nany change to update the value of that binding.\r\n• Where change listeners let us provide executable code ahead of time, binding gives us the convenience of\r\nstringing two properties together without having to worry about the implementation of updating a particular\r\nvalue.\r\n• The simplest and most heavily used are the methods that come attached to Property objects themselves:\r\n• bind()\r\n• bindBidirectional().\r\n• These represent the simplest options for one-way and two-way bindings.\r\n17\r\nOne-directional binding\r\n• When you invoke the bind() method on a target property, you pass it a second property as an argument\r\n– the binding source\r\nStringProperty sourceProperty = new SimpleStringProperty(\"First Value\");\r\nStringProperty targetProperty = new SimpleStringProperty(\"Second Value\");\r\ntargetProperty.bind(sourceProperty);\r\n• Under the bonnet, the target stores a reference to the new source property and listens for changes.\r\n• When the source value changes, it automatically updates the target (itself) when a change is\r\ndetected.\r\n• In this case, targetProperty will track the value of sourceProperty. A few notes on extra bits for this method:\r\n• If the property is currently bound, the current binding is deleted and the new one replaces it\r\n• If a null argument is provided, the method throws a NullPointerExeption\r\n• The method immediately copies the value of the property it’s listening to, so the current value of the target property\r\nis lost.\r\n18\r\nTwo-directional binding\r\n• It is, of course, possible to wire the properties together in both directions, linking their values together so\r\nthat their values are always the same.\r\n• To accomplish this, we invoke bindBidirectional(), passing the source property as an argument again.\r\nStringProperty sourceProperty = new SimpleStringProperty(\"First Value\");\r\nStringProperty targetProperty = new SimpleStringProperty(\"Second Value\");\r\ntargetProperty.bindBidirectional(sourceProperty);\r\n• If the values of the properties are different, then the order of the method call is important in determining the\r\nstart value for the binding.\r\n• The method applied to targetProperty immediately updates the value of targetProperty before\r\nsourceProperty is bound reciprocally.\r\n• That means that after a bidirectional binding, both properties will have the value of the property\r\npassed as an argument (the source property).\r\n• In addition to the basic binding, which is limited to a carbon-copy approach, JavaFX supports more\r\ncomplex binding: creating multiple or complex manipulations of"

retains our focus\r\n• Less impedance; code closely trails the business intent\r\n• Less error prone\r\n• Easier to understand and maintain\r\nDeclarative style - Example\r\npublic class Cities {\r\npublic static void findChicagoImperative(final List<String> cities)\r\n{ boolean found = false;\r\nfor(String city : cities) {\r\nif(city.equals(\"Chicago\")) {\r\nfound = true;\r\nbreak;\r\n}\r\n}\r\nSystem.out.println(\"Found chicago?:\" + found);\r\n}\r\npublic static void main(final String[] args) {\r\nList<String> cities = Arrays.asList(\"Albany\", \"Boulder\", \"Chicago\",\r\n\"Denver\", \"Eugene\");\r\nfindChicagoImperative(cities);\r\n}\r\n}\r\nJavaFX – Button onAction\r\nButton btn = new Button();\r\nbtn.setOnAction(new EventHandler<ActionEvent>() {\r\npublic void handle(ActionEvent event) {\r\nSystem.out.println(\"Hello World\");\r\n} });\r\n• You will notice that this code looks very verbose just to wire up a button.\r\n• Buried deep in an anonymous inner class is a single line to output text. Wouldn’t it be nice to be able to\r\nexpress a block of code containing the behavior you want without the need of so much boilerplate code?\r\n• Rewriting the button handler code.\r\nbtn.setOnAction(event -> System.out.println(\"Hello World\") );\r\n• Using lambda expressions not only makes code concise and easy to read, but the code is also likely to\r\nperform better.\r\n• Actually, under the hood, the compiler is capable of optimizing code and likely to be able to reduce its\r\nfootprint.\r\nLambda Expressions - Syntax\r\n• There are two ways to specify lambda expressions.\r\n(param1, param2, ...) -> expression;\r\n(param1, param2, ...) -> { /* code statements */ };\r\n• Lambda expressions begin with a list of parameters surrounded by parentheses, followed by the arrow\r\nsymbol -> (a hyphen and a greater-than sign) and an expression body.\r\n• The surrounding parentheses are optional only if there is one parameter defined.\r\n• When the expression doesn’t accept parameters (and is said to be empty), the parentheses are still\r\nrequired.\r\n• Separating the parameter list and the expression body is the arrow symbol.\r\n• The expression body or code block may or may not be surrounded by curly braces.\r\n• When the expression body doesn’t have surrounding curly braces, it must consist of only one statement.\r\nWhen an expression is a one-line statement, it is evaluated and returned to the caller implicitly.\r\n• If the method requires a return type and your code block has curly braces, you must have a return\r\nstatement.\r\n// explicit return of result\r\nFunction<Double, Double> func = x -> { return x * x; }\r\n// evaluates & implicitly returns result\r\nFunction<Double, Double> func = x -> x * x;\r\ndouble y = func(2.0); // x = 4.0\r\nLambda Expression\r\n• Simple Method vs Lambda\r\nString doSomething(String txt){\r\nreturn txt.toUpperCase();\r\n}\r\n• Lambda has three basic elements as well.\r\n(String txt) -> { return txt.toUpperCase();}\r\nreturn type parameter list\r\nFunction Body\r\nParameter list Function body\r\nNew Arrow to indicate it is lambda\r\nLambda Expression\r\n(String txt) -> { return txt.toUpperCase();}\r\n• Lambda methods are also called anonymous methods due to reason they don’t\r\nhave names.\r\n• Lambda methods don’t define return type, the return type is defined in the\r\nfunctional interface.\r\n• It's the context in which we assign this lambda that the compiler knows\r\nwhat the return type is.\r\nLambda Expression\r\n(int x, int y) -> {\r\nif (x > y)\r\nreturn x;\r\nelse\r\nreturn y;\r\n}\r\n• The above lambda expression, can be used to implement the functional Interface\r\nwhose abstract method takes two integers as arguments and returns an integer.\r\n• Because the compiler knows the method signature of that abstract method, it\r\nisn't necessary to explicitly call out the parameter types.\r\n(x, y) -> {\r\nif (x > y)\r\nreturn x;\r\nelse\r\nreturn y;\r\n}\r\n(x, y) -> {\r\nreturn (x > y ? x\r\n: y);\r\n}\r\n(x, y) -> (x > y ? x : y)\r\n• Three Syntactically Equivalent Lambda Expressions to Set Action Code on a JavaFX Button\r\nbtn.setOnAction( (ActionEvent event) -> {System.out.println(event); } );\r\nbtn.setOnAction( (event) -> System.out.println(event) );\r\nbtn.setOnAction( event -> System.out.println(event) );\r\nFunctional Interfaces\r\n• Any Java interface which contains one and only one abstract method.\r\n@FunctionalInterface\r\npublic interface Messenger{\r\nvoid notify(String msg, int count);\r\n}\r\n• The abstract method defined in a functional interface is the contract for\r\nany lambdas which will implement the functional interface.\r\n@FunctionalInterface\r\npublic interface Something<T,R>{\r\nR apply(T param);\r\n}\r\n• Functional interfaces can be generic interfaces or explicitly typed\r\ninterfaces.\r\nMethod Reference\r\n• Often when using lambdas, there are methods that take a single parameter as input or a single value as\r\na return type.\r\n• This is very redundant so, new in Java 8 is the concept of method references.\r\n• Method references are basically syntactic sugar that allow you to make method calls with even less\r\nverbosity, subsequently making things easier to read.\r\n• For example, the following is a lambda expression that uses a method reference:\r\nbtn.setOnAction(System.out::println);\r\n• This code sets the action on the button, and you’ll notice it’s a concise version that behaves the same\r\nway as in before example.\r\n• The difference is that there isn’t an input parameter for the ActionEvent for the lambda and an unusual\r\ndouble colon between the System.out and the println method.\r\n• The double colon is called the scope operator, and it references the method by name.\r\n• You’ll also notice the println method’s parentheses are absent.\r\n• If you remember, whenever a lambda expression takes a single parameter as input, the parameter is\r\nimplicitly passed to the method println that takes a single input.\r\n• Of course, both types must be the same.\r\n• The event object in the example will implicitly call toString() to pass a String to the println\r\nmethod.\r\nFunctional Interfaces\r\n• The advent of cloud computing has helped to reinvigorate many functional programming languages.\r\n• It became apparent there was a paradigm shift in problem-solving that involves extremely large datasets.\r\n• A typical use case when applying functional programming techniques is the ability to iterate over datasets\r\nwhile performing computations in a distributed fashion so that load can be shared among nodes or CPU cores.\r\n• In contrast, imperative programming languages gather data to then be passed into a tight for loop to be\r\nprocessed.\r\n• Because of how data and code are coupled, this puts a lot of the burden on one thread (core) to process so\r\nmuch data.\r\n• The problem needs to be decomposed to allow other threads (cores) to participate in the computation, which\r\nthen becomes distributed.\r\n• One of the advantages of functional programming is the ability to express functionality in a syntactically\r\nconcise manner, but more important is the ability to pass functionality (lambda expressions) to methods.\r\n• Being able to pass lambda expressions to methods often fosters the concept of lazy evaluation.\r\n• This behavior is the same as function callback behavior (asynchronous message passing), where invocations\r\nare deferred (and thus “lazy”) until a later time.\r\n• The opposite of lazy evaluation is eager evaluation.\r\n• Using lazy evaluations will often increase performance by avoiding unnecessary calculations.\r\n• A functional interface is basically a single abstract method (SAM).\r\n• The idea of functional interfaces has been around for a very long time.\r\nFunctional Interfaces\r\n• For instance, those who have worked with Java threads will recall using the Runnable interface,\r\nwhere there is a single run() method with a void return type.\r\n• The single abstract method pattern is an integral part of Java 8’s lambda expressions.\r\n// functional interface\r\ninterface MyEquation {\r\ndouble compute(double val1, double val2);\r\n}\r\n• After creating a functional interface, you can declare a variable to be assigned with a lambda expression.\r\nMyEquation area = (height, width) -> height * width;\r\nMyEquation perimeter = (height, width) -> 2*height + 2*width;\r\nSystem.out.println(\"Area = \" + area.compute(3, 4));\r\nSystem.out.println(\"Perimeter = \" + perimeter.compute(3, 4));\r\n//Output:\r\nArea: 12.0\r\nPerimeter: 14.0\r\nFunctional Interfaces\r\n• The Annotation @:\r\n• The annotation has no affect on the code but just a compile time check to\r\nsee if the interface under is following the functional Interface definition or\r\nnot which is having only and only one abstract method.\r\n• We don’t require to create our own functional interfaces all the time\r\nwhile dealing with lambda’s, mostly they are used when we delt with\r\nCollections and Streams.\r\n• Java has a handful list of functional interfaces defined in\r\njava.util.function package. Few basic one are\r\n• Function: takes one argument and produces the results, used to map one\r\nobject of one type to another type of object.\r\n• Consumer: takes one argument and doesn’t return anything, used to iterate\r\nover multiple objects.\r\n• Predicate: take one argument and always returns true or false, used to\r\nperform key filter operations on collections of objects.\r\nSingle Parameter Lambda Syntax\r\n(String txt) -> return txt.toUpperCase()\r\n• With a single parameter lambdas, not only can we drop the parameter\r\ntype, but we can also lose the parentheses.\r\n• This makes our lambda is a little lighter without losing any readability.\r\n• The key here is that the arrow token is what signals this as a lambda\r\nexpression.\r\n• We can't forget that we can also reduce this lambda body if it contains a\r\nsingle statement.\r\nReview\r\n• No need to add parameters types: because lambdas are single abstract\r\nmethods and due to functional interface, the complier knows its types.\r\n(x , y) -> {...}\r\n• Reduce the bodies of single statement lambdas, no need of { }, return or ;\r\n(x , y) -> x * y\r\n• Single parameters lambdas doesn’t require parathesis.\r\nx -> {...}\r\n() -> {...}\r\nExample\r\npublic class Example{\r\npublic static void main(String[] args){\r\nConvert<String, Boolean> str2Bool = (s) -> { return\r\nBoolean.parseBoolean(s);};\r\nSystem.out.println(str2Bool.apply(\"TRUE\"));\r\nSystem.out.println(str2Bool.apply(\"tRuE\"));\r\nSystem.out.println(str2Bool.apply(\"faLsE\"));\r\nSystem.out.println(str2Bool.apply(\"No\"));\r\nSystem.out.println(str2Bool.apply(null));\r\nConvert<Boolean, Integer> Bool2Int = b -> b ? 1 : 0;\r\nSystem.out.println(Bool2Int.apply(true));\r\n}\r\n}\r\n@FunctionalInterface\r\ninterface Converter<T,R>{\r\nR apply(T source);\r\n}\r\nLambda Expressions\r\n• A lambda expression can be understood as a concise representation of\r\nan anonymous function that can be passed around.\r\n• Anonymous— We say anonymous because it doesn’t have an explicit\r\nname like a method would normally have: less to write and think about!\r\n• Function— We say function because a lambda isn’t associated with a\r\nparticular class like a method is. But like a method, a lambda has a list of\r\nparameters, a body, a return type, and a possible list of exceptions that\r\ncan be thrown.\r\n• Passed around— A lambda expression can be passed as argument to a\r\nmethod or stored in a variable.\r\n• Concise— You don’t need to write a lot of boilerplate like you do for\r\nanonymous classes.\r\nWhy should be care about Lambda Expression?\r\n• In previous segment as we have seen that passing behaviors using\r\ninterfaces is tedious and verbose.\r\n• Lambda first of all fix that problem of tediousness.\r\n• With the use of it you shouldn’t be writing clumsy code using\r\nanonymous classes.\r\n• Your code become clearer and more flexible.\r\nWhy should be care about Lambda Expression?\r\n• Code using Anonymous classes\r\nComparator<Apple> byWeight = new Comparator<Apple>() {\r\npublic int compare(Apple a1, Apple a2){\r\nreturn a1.getWeight().compareTo(a2.getWeight());\r\n}\r\n};\r\n• Code using Lambda\r\nComparator<Apple> byWeight =\r\n(a1, a2) -> a1.getWeight().compareTo(a2.getWeight());\r\njava.util.function.Predicate<T> Interface\r\n• Defines an abstract method named test that accepts an\r\nobject of generic type T and returns a Boolean.\r\n• You might want to use this interface when you need to\r\nrepresent a boolean expression that uses an object of type T.\r\n• For example, you can define a lambda that accepts String\r\nobjects.\r\njava.util.function.Consumer<T> Interface\r\n• Defines an abstract method named accept that takes an\r\nobject of generic type T and returns no result (void).\r\n• You might use this interface when you need to access an\r\nobject of type T and perform some operations on it.\r\n• For example, you can use it to create a method forEach, which\r\ntakes a list of Integers and applies an operation on each\r\nelement of that list.\r\njava.util.function.Function<T,R> Interface\r\n• Defines an abstract method named apply that takes an\r\nobject of generic type T as input and returns an object of\r\ngeneric type R.\r\n• You might use this interface when you need to define a\r\nlambda that maps information from an input object to an\r\noutput.\r\n• For example, extracting the weight of an apple or mapping a\r\nstring to its length.\r\nFunctional Style Data Processing\r\n• Collections is the most heavily used API in Java.\r\n• What would you do without collections?\r\n• Nearly every Java application makes and processes collections.\r\n• Collections are fundamental to many programming tasks:\r\n• They let you group and process data.\r\n• To illustrate collections in action, imagine you want to create a\r\ncollection of dishes to represent a menu and then iterate through\r\nit to sum the calories of each dish.\r\n• You may want to process the collection to select only low-calorie\r\ndishes for a special healthy menu.\r\n• But despite collections being necessary for almost any Java\r\napplication, manipulating collections is far from perfect\r\nWhat are Streams?\r\n• Streams are an update to the Java API that lets you manipulate\r\ncollections of data in a declarative way (you express a query rather than\r\ncode an ad hoc implementation for it).\r\n• For now you can think of them as fancy iterators over a collection of data.\r\n• Streams can also be processed in parallel transparently, without you\r\nhaving to write any multithreaded code.\r\nStreams\r\n• A pipeline is a "

When the dialog box is closed with the OK\r\nbutton, the model is updated with these new changes.\r\n• When the dialog box is closed with the CANCEL button, the model remains unchanged.\r\n• When either button is clicked, the dialog box closes.\r\n• The closing of the dialog box using the standard \"close\" (i.e., X at the top corner) should be treated as a\r\ncancel operation. 3\r\n• The dialog box itself is easy to make. It is simply another window. To create your own, simply make it a\r\nsubclass of Dialog:\r\npublic class MyDialogBox extends Dialog {\r\n...\r\n}\r\n• Then, you can add components and event handlers to this dialog box as if it were a Pane.\r\n• Typically, you will ensure that there is some combination of ok/apply and cancel/close buttons which are\r\nusually located at the bottom right or bottom center of a dialog box.\r\n• There are various constructors in the Dialog class. We will use the following format for our constructors:\r\npublic MyDialog(Stage owner, String title, ...) {\r\nsetTitle(title);\r\n}\r\n• The owner parameter is usually the main application's Stage object.\r\n• The title parameter is what will appear on the dialog box title bar.\r\n• We may also want to supply additional model-related parameters to pass information into the dialog box.\r\n• Often the model itself is passed in as a parameter so that we can (1) fill in the dialog box information based\r\non the current model data, and (2) then we can modify the model as necessary after the user makes changes\r\nto the data and presses OK.\r\n4\r\n• So, dialog boxes are easy to\r\ncreate ... but how do we\r\ncoordinate the interaction with\r\nthe main application window\r\nand its dialog box ?\r\n• The dialog box is defined in a separate class than its owner application.\r\n• As a result, the owner (i.e., the application that brought up the dialog box) has no idea what is going on within the\r\ndialog box class (nor should it need to know).\r\n• The owner, however, usually needs to know whether or not the interaction with the dialog box was accepted (i.e.,\r\nOK was pressed) or whether or not it was cancelled.\r\n• That is, it may need to know whether or not changes were made to the model.\r\n• The simplest way to do this is to define what is to be returned when the dialog box closes.\r\n• The Dialog class has a method called setResultConverter() which allows us to provide a function to be called\r\nwhich will define what is to be returned from the Dialog box when it is closed.\r\n• We can return null to indicate that it was cancelled, and something else otherwise. Here is the basic format:\r\nsetResultConverter(new Callback<ButtonType, RETURN_TYPE>() {\r\npublic RETURN_TYPE call(ButtonType b) {\r\nif (b == okButtonType) {\r\nRETURN_TYPE result = new RETURN_TYPE();\r\n// ... Extract data from the Dialog box to fill in result ... return result;\r\n}\r\nreturn null;\r\n}\r\n});\r\n• Here, RETURN_TYPE could be any type of object that we want returned from the dialog box.\r\n6\r\n• When bringing up the Dialog box, we use this code:\r\nOptional<RETURN_TYPE> result = myDialog.showAndWait();\r\nif (result.isPresent()) { // Do something }\r\nelse { // Do something else }\r\n• The RETURN_TYPE should match what was set in the dialog box.\r\n7\r\nEmailBuddy Example (Custom Dialog Box)\r\n8\r\n• Consider having many \"buddies\" (i.e., friends) that you send e-mails to regularly.\r\n• Consider making a nice little “electronic” address book that you can store the buddy's names along with\r\nhis/her e-mail addresses.\r\n• Perhaps you even want to categorize the buddies as being \"hot\" (i.e., you talk to them often), or \"not-so-hot\".\r\nWhat exactly is an e-mail buddy ?\r\n• Well, we can easily develop a simple model of an EmailBuddy as follows\r\nModel Class for EmailBuddy\r\n9\r\npublic class EmailBuddy {\r\nprivate String name, address;\r\nprivate boolean onHotList;\r\n// Here are some constructors\r\npublic EmailBuddy() { name = \"\"; address = \"\"; onHotList = false; }\r\npublic EmailBuddy(String aName, String anAddress) {\r\nname = aName; address = anAddress; onHotList = false; }\r\n// Here are the get methods\r\npublic String getName() { return name; }\r\npublic String getAddress() { return address; }\r\npublic boolean onHotList() { return onHotList; }\r\n// Here are the set methods\r\npublic void setName(String newName) { name = newName; }\r\npublic void setAddress(String newAddress) { address = newAddress; }\r\npublic void onHotList(boolean onList) { onHotList = onList; }\r\n// The appearance of the buddy\r\npublic String toString() { return(name); }\r\n}\r\nModel Class for EmailBuddyList\r\n10\r\n• As you may have noticed, there is nothing difficult here ... just your standard \"run-of-the-mill\" model class.\r\n• However, this class alone does not represent the whole model for our GUI since we will have many of these\r\nEmailBuddy objects.\r\n• So, we will need a class to represent the list.\r\npublic class EmailBuddyList {\r\npublic final int MAXIMUM_SIZE = 100;\r\nprivate EmailBuddy[] buddies;\r\nprivate int size; public EmailBuddyList() {\r\nbuddies = new EmailBuddy[MAXIMUM_SIZE]; size = 0; }\r\n// Return the number of buddies in the whole list\r\npublic int getSize() { return size; }\r\n// Return all the buddies\r\npublic EmailBuddy[] getEmailBuddies() { return buddies; }\r\n// Get a particular buddy from the list, given the index\r\npublic EmailBuddy getBuddy(int i) { return buddies[i]; }\r\n// Add an email buddy to the list unless it has reached its capacity\r\npublic void add(EmailBuddy buddy) {\r\n// Make sure that we do not go past the limit\r\nif (size < MAXIMUM_SIZE) buddies[size++] = buddy;\r\n}\r\n// Remove the buddy with the given index from the list\r\npublic void remove(int index) {\r\n// Make sure that the given index is valid\r\nif ((index >= 0) && (index < size)) {\r\n// Move every item after the deleted one up in the list\r\nfor (int i=index; i<size-1; i++)\r\nbuddies[i] = buddies[i+1];\r\nsize--; // Reduce the list size by 1\r\n}\r\n}\r\n// Return the number of buddies on the hot list\r\npublic int getHotListSize() {\r\nint count = 0;\r\nfor (int i=0; i<size; i++)\r\nif (buddies[i].onHotList()) count++;\r\nreturn count;\r\n}\r\n// Get a particular \"hot\" buddy from the list, given the hot list index\r\npublic EmailBuddy getHotListBuddy(int i) {\r\nint count = 0;\r\nfor (int j=0; j<size; j++) {\r\nif (buddies[j].onHotList()) {\r\nif (count == i)\r\nreturn buddies[j];\r\ncount++;\r\n}\r\n}\r\nreturn null;\r\n}\r\n}\r\n11\r\n• Notice that there is a getSize() method that is a simple \"get\" method and there is also a\r\ngetHotListSize() method that returns the number of buddies on the hot list.\r\n• Notice as well that there are methods to get a buddy at a given index in the array.\r\n• The method getHotListBuddy() will find the ith buddy that is on the hot list. You will see soon why\r\nthese methods will be useful.\r\n• The task now is to design a nice interface for the main application.\r\n• To start, we must decide what the interface should do. Here is a possible interface:\r\n• A list of all buddies is shown (names only)\r\n• We should be able to: o Add and Remove buddies from the list\r\n• Edit buddies when their name or email changes\r\n• Show only those buddies that are \"hot\" or perhaps show all of them\r\n12\r\n• Assume that we have decided upon the\r\nfollowing view for the interface:\r\n• Notice that the interface does not show the e-\r\nmail addresses in the list.\r\n• It may look cluttered, but we could certainly\r\nhave done this.\r\n• Perhaps we could have made a second list box\r\nor something that would show the e-mail\r\naddresses.\r\n• Here is a practice exercise:\r\n• make a TextField just beneath the list that will show the\r\ne-mail address of the currently selected EmailBuddy in\r\nthe list. This is not hard to do.\r\n13\r\n• How can we build the view for this interface ? We will start by making a special GridPane and place various\r\ncomponents on it:\r\npublic class EmailBuddyPanel extends GridPane {\r\nprivate EmailBuddyList model; // This is the list of buddies\r\n// The components on the window\r\nprivate ListView<EmailBuddy> buddyList;\r\nprivate Button addButton;\r\nprivate Button removeButton;\r\nprivate CheckBox hotListButton;\r\npublic ListView<EmailBuddy> getBuddyList() { return buddyList; }\r\npublic Button getAddButton() { return addButton; }\r\npublic Button getRemoveButton() { return removeButton; }\r\npublic CheckBox getHotListButton() { return hotListButton; }\r\npublic EmailBuddyPanel(EmailBuddyList m) {\r\nmodel = m; // Store the model so that the update() method can access it\r\nsetPadding(new Insets(10, 10, 10, 10));\r\nbuddyList = new ListView<EmailBuddy>();\r\nbuddyList.setItems(FXCollections.observableArrayList(m.getEmailBuddies()));\r\nadd(buddyList,0,0,1,3); // spans 1 column, 3 rows\r\nbuddyList.setPrefHeight(Integer.MAX_VALUE);\r\nbuddyList.setMinWidth(200);\r\nbuddyList.setPrefWidth(Integer.MAX_VALUE);\r\n14\r\naddButton = new Button(\"Add\"); add(addButton,1,0);\r\nsetMargin(addButton, new Insets(0, 0, 10, 10));\r\nsetValignment(addButton, VPos.TOP); setHalignment(addButton, HPos.CENTER);\r\naddButton.setMinHeight(25); addButton.setMinWidth(100);\r\nremoveButton = new Button(\"Remove\"); add(removeButton,1,1);\r\nsetMargin(removeButton, new Insets(0, 0, 10, 10));\r\nsetValignment(removeButton, VPos.TOP);\r\nsetHalignment(removeButton, HPos.CENTER); removeButton.setMinHeight(25);\r\nremoveButton.setMinWidth(100);\r\nhotListButton = new CheckBox(\"Show Hot List\");\r\nadd(hotListButton,1,2);\r\nsetMargin(hotListButton, new Insets(0, 0, 10, 10));\r\nsetValignment(hotListButton, VPos.TOP);\r\nsetHalignment(hotListButton, HPos.CENTER);\r\nhotListButton.setMinHeight(25);\r\nhotListButton.setMinWidth(100);\r\n// Now update the components by filling them in\r\nupdate();\r\n}\r\n// Update the components so that they reflect the contents of the model\r\npublic void update() { //... coming soon ... }\r\n}\r\n15\r\n• Notice that we are making our class a subclass of GridPane.\r\n• That allow us to directly add the components by using add() within the constructor.\r\n• Also notice that the constructor takes an EmailBuddyList as a parameter.\r\n• We will fill in the list with the data from this parameter.\r\n• The list is of type ListView<EmailBuddy> which allows us to populate it with EmailBuddy objects.\r\n• At the end of the constructor, we call the update() method.\r\n• Recall that the update() method should read from the model and then refresh the \"look\" of the components.\r\n• The only components that need their appearance updated is the list and the remove button.\r\n• The remove button is easily updated as we simply disable it when there is nothing selected in the list:\r\nremoveButton.setDisable(buddyList.getSelectionModel().getSelectedIndex() < 0);\r\n• The list is more complicated. First of all, we need to populate the list with the most recent data.\r\n• Recall that we did something similar in the grocery list example.\r\n16\r\n• We need to create an appropriate-sized array and then fill it up with email buddies and then set the list data\r\nEmailBuddy[] exactList;\r\nexactList = new EmailBuddy[model.getSize()];\r\nfor (int i=0; i<model.getSize(); i++)\r\nexactList[i] = model.getBuddy(i);\r\nbuddyList.setItems(FXCollections.observableArrayList(exactList));\r\n• However, things are a little more difficult now. If we have the hot list button selected, then we do not want all\r\nthe buddies ... instead we want only those on the hot list:\r\nexactList = new EmailBuddy[model.getHotListSize()];\r\nfor (int i=0; i<model.getHotListSize(); i++)\r\nexactList[i] = model.getHotListBuddy(i);\r\nbuddyList.setItems(FXCollections.observableArrayList(exactList));\r\n17\r\n• We can use an IF statement to select the appropriate code:\r\nEmailBuddy[] exactList;\r\nif (hotListButton.isSelected()) {\r\nexactList = new EmailBuddy[model.getHotListSize()];\r\nfor (int i = 0; i < model.getHotListSize(); i++)\r\nexactList[i] = model.getHotListBuddy(i);\r\n}\r\nelse {\r\nexactList = new EmailBuddy[model.getSize()];\r\nfor (int i=0; i<model.getSize(); i++)\r\nexactList[i] = model.getBuddy(i);\r\n}\r\nbuddyList.setItems(FXCollections.observableArrayList(exactList));\r\n• One last point ... as we will see later when editing a buddy, sometimes the ListView does not refresh\r\nproperly. To fix this, we simply first need to set the ListView contents to null first before setting it to the value\r\nthat we want.\r\nbuddyList.setItems(null); /// Seems to be required for a proper update\r\nbuddyList.setItems(FXCollections.observableArrayList(exactList));\r\n18\r\n• We will also need to ensure that we select the selected item each time we make an update.\r\n• That is, if we were to select an item from the list and then update ... we want to make sure that the item\r\nremains selected.\r\n• At this point, when we refresh the list contents, the selected item does not remain selected.\r\n• So, we will need to remember which item was selected and then reselect it again after the list is re-populated.\r\n• Here is the final update() method that must be added to the view code:\r\n// Update the components so that they reflect the contents of the model\r\npublic void update() {\r\n// Remember what was selected\r\nint selectedItem = buddyList.getSelectionModel().getSelectedIndex();\r\n// Now re-populate the list by creating and returning a new\r\n// array with the exact size of the number of items in it.\r\nEmailBuddy[] exactList;\r\nif (hotListButton.isSelected()) {\r\nexactList = new EmailBuddy[model.getHotListSize()];\r\nfor (int i = 0; i < model.getHotListSize(); i++)\r\nexactList[i] = model.getHotListBuddy(i);\r\n}\r\n19\r\nelse {\r\nexactList = new EmailBuddy[model.getSize()];\r\nfor (int i=0; i<model.getSize(); i++)\r\nexactList[i] = model.getBuddy(i);\r\n}\r\nbuddyList.setItems(null); /// Seems to be required for a proper update\r\nbuddyList.setItems(FXCollections.observableArrayList(exactList));\r\n// Reselect the selected item\r\nbuddyList.getSelectionModel().select(selectedItem);\r\n// Enable/disable the Remove button accordingly\r\nremoveButton.setDisable(buddyList.getSelectionModel().getSelectedIndex() < 0);\r\n}\r\n20\r\n• The controller will keep track of the view as well as the model.\r\n• We will be handling events for the pressing of the addButton, removeButton, hotListButton as well as buddyList selection.\r\n• Here is the basic framework for the controller:\r\npublic class EmailBuddyApp extends Application {\r\nprivate EmailBuddyList model; // The model\r\nprivate EmailBuddyPanel view; // The view\r\npublic void start(Stage primaryStage) {\r\n// Initially, no buddies\r\nmodel = new EmailBuddyList();\r\n// Make a new viewing panel and add it to the pane\r\nview = new EmailBuddyPanel(model);\r\n//Handle the Add button\r\nview.getAddButton().setOnAction(new EventHandler<ActionEvent>() {\r\n// This is the single event handler for all of the buttons\r\npublic void handle(ActionEvent actionEvent) {\r\n// Add buddy (code will be shown later) }\r\n});\r\n// Handle the Remove button\r\nview.getRemoveButton().setOnAction(new EventHandler<ActionEvent>() {\r\n// This is the single event handler for all of the buttons\r\npublic void handle(ActionEvent actionEvent) {\r\n// Remove buddy (code will be shown later) }\r\n});\r\n21\r\n// Handle the Hot List Button\r\nview.getHotListButton().setOnAction(new EventHandler<ActionEvent>() {\r\n// This is the single event handler for all of the buttons\r\npublic void handle(ActionEvent actionEvent) { view.update(); }\r\n});\r\n// Handle a double-click in the list\r\nview.getBuddyList().setOnMousePressed(new EventHandler<MouseEvent>() {\r\npublic void handle(MouseEvent mouseEvent) {\r\nif (mouseEvent.getClickCount() == 2)\r\n// Edit buddy (code will be shown later)\r\nview.update();\r\n}\r\n});\r\nprimaryStage.setTitle(\"Email Buddy App\");\r\nprimaryStage.setScene(new Scene(view, 400,300));\r\nprimaryStage.show();\r\n}\r\npublic static void main(String[] args) { launch(args); } }\r\n22\r\n• Notice that the code is straight forward.\r\n• The hot list button event handler only requires a refreshing of the list,\r\nso the view's update() method is called.\r\n• We now need to decide what to do when the user clicks the Add\r\nbutton, Remove button and OnHotList button as well as when the\r\nuser selects an item from the list.\r\n• The Add button should bring up a dialog box to allow us to add a new\r\nbuddy.\r\n• We have not created this dialog box, but we will do so soon.\r\n• The adding of the new email buddy should only occur if the user\r\npresses the OK button.\r\n• If the CANCEL button is pressed, or the dialog box is closed down,\r\nthen no email buddy should be added.\r\n• To make the code simpler, it is a good idea to create the new email\r\nbuddy when the Add button is pressed so that we can pass this buddy\r\ninto the dialog box so that its contents can be set.\r\n• If the user presses OK afterwards, we can add this new buddy to the\r\nmodel.\r\n• The dialog box should allow the user to set the name, address and hot\r\nlist status for the buddy that it is working on (i.e., either a newly added\r\nbuddy or one being edited). Here is what the dialog box will look like:\r\n23\r\n• We can create this dialog in a class called BuddyDetailsDialog.\r\n• It will be a subclass of the Dialog class.\r\n• The constructor will take three parameters:\r\n• the owner, which is a stage\r\n• a title for the window\r\n• an EmailBuddy to be edited.\r\n• Here is the basic code that will bring up the window with the two Labels, TextFields and Checkbox:\r\npublic class BuddyDetailsDialog extends Dialog {\r\npublic BuddyDetailsDialog(Stage owner, String title, EmailBuddy bud) {\r\nsetTitle(title);\r\n// Set the button types\r\nButtonType okButtonType = new ButtonType(\"OK\",\r\nButtonBar.ButtonData.OK_DONE);\r\ngetDialogPane().getButtonTypes().addAll(okButtonType,\r\nButtonType.CANCEL);\r\n// Create the and and address labels and fields.\r\nGridPane grid = new GridPane(); grid.setHgap(10); grid.setVgap(10);\r\ngrid.setPadding(new Insets(10, 10, 10, 10));\r\nTextField nameField = new TextField(bud.getName());\r\nnameField.setPromptText(\"Person's name to be shown in the list\");\r\nnameField.setMinW"

Then JAVA FX does the rest.\r\n• The Alert class is used to represent a standard dialog box in JAVA FX.\r\n3\r\nAlert alert = new Alert(Alert.AlertType.INFORMATION);\r\n• The dialog box is then shown by using:\r\nalert.showAndWait();\r\n• It is a simple, plain dialog box that remains open until the user presses the OK button.\r\n• However, the dialog box is customizable.\r\n• We can alter the title of the window, the \"header\" portion of the dialog box (i.e., the text to the left of the\r\nicon) as well as add some additional context-related text just above the OK button.\r\nalert.setTitle(\"Message To the User\");\r\nalert.setHeaderText(\"Important Reminder\");\r\nalert.setContentText(\"If you inserted a USB flash drive, make sure \" +\r\n\"to take it with you when you leave. Some \" +\r\n\"students have been forgetting their USB drive\" +\r\n\" in the lab only to find that it is not there\" +\r\n\" when they come back to look for it.\");\r\n4\r\n• You can also eliminate the Header text by setting it to null:\r\nalert.setHeaderText(null);\r\n• You can change the icon from being an \"information\" icon to that of being a \"warning\" icon or an \"error\"\r\nicon simply by altering the static value used when creating the Alert:\r\nAlert alert = new Alert(Alert.AlertType.WARNING);\r\nalert.setTitle(\"Tip for the day\");\r\nalert.setHeaderText(null);\r\nalert.setContentText(\"Don't eat yellow snow.\");\r\n5\r\n• In addition to these simple messages, we can also have a message dialog come up with a lot of text within it\r\nby adding a TextArea to the Alert.\r\nAlert alert = new Alert(Alert.AlertType.ERROR);\r\nalert.setTitle(\"Error\"); alert.setHeaderText(null);\r\nalert.setContentText(\"Invalid Gregorian Calendar Date\");\r\nLabel label = new Label(\"Date entered:\");\r\nTextArea textArea = new TextArea(new GregorianCalendar().toString());\r\ntextArea.setEditable(false); textArea.setWrapText(true);\r\ntextArea.setMaxWidth(Double.MAX_VALUE);\r\ntextArea.setMaxHeight(Double.MAX_VALUE);\r\nGridPane.setVgrow(textArea, Priority.ALWAYS);\r\nGridPane.setHgrow(textArea, Priority.ALWAYS);\r\nGridPane expandableContent = new GridPane();\r\nexpandableContent.setMaxWidth(Double.MAX_VALUE);\r\nexpandableContent.add(label, 0, 0);\r\nexpandableContent.add(textArea, 0, 1);\r\nalert.getDialogPane().setExpandableContent(expandableContent);\r\n• Notice that we are just using a standard error dialog but that we are adding a GridPane with a Label and a\r\nTextArea. We added the data from today's date, created from a new GregorianCalendar object.\r\n6\r\n• The setExpandableContent() method\r\nallows us to add that extra GridPane to\r\nthe dialog box in a way that will allow\r\nthe user to Hide or Show it as extra\r\ndetail. Here is what the dialog box\r\nlooks like with the data hidden.\r\n• And here is what it looks like with the\r\nexpanded data being shown\r\n7\r\n• In addition to showing just simple messages, we can have dialog boxes that allow the user to make a\r\nsimple decision.\r\nAlert alert = new Alert(Alert.AlertType.CONFIRMATION);\r\nalert.setTitle(\"Answer this Question\");\r\nalert.setHeaderText(null);\r\nalert.setContentText(\"Do you want me to clean up your hard drive ?\");\r\nOptional<ButtonType> result = alert.showAndWait();\r\nif (result.get() == ButtonType.OK){\r\nSystem.out.println(\"OK, I'm erasing it now ...\"); }\r\nelse { System.out.println(\"Fine then, you clean it up!\"); }\r\n8\r\n• Notice that we can ask for the result from the showAndWait() method.\r\n• We can use the get() method to find out which ButtonType was pressed (i.e., OK or\r\nCANCEL), and then act accordingly.\r\n• If the user closes the window by pressing the X on the top right, this is considered as\r\nCANCEL in our code.\r\n• We can even customize the buttons on this confirmation dialog box.\r\n• Consider a bunch of options like this the picture above.\r\n9\r\n• We can do this with a standard confirmation dialog box where we replace the buttons with our own choices:\r\nAlert alert = new Alert(Alert.AlertType.CONFIRMATION);\r\nalert.setTitle(\"Pick an Option\"); alert.setHeaderText(null);\r\nalert.setContentText(\"How would you rate your vehicle's performance ?\");\r\nButtonType[] buttons = new ButtonType[6];\r\nString[] buttonNames = {\"Outstanding\", \"Excellent\", \"Good\", \"Fair\", \"Poor\"};\r\nalert.getButtonTypes().setAll(); // Erases the default buttons\r\nfor (int i=0; i<5; i++) {\r\nbuttons[i] = new ButtonType(buttonNames[i]);\r\nalert.getButtonTypes().add(buttons[i]); // Adds this new button\r\n}\r\n// Add a cancel button\r\nalert.getButtonTypes().add(new ButtonType(\"Cancel\",\r\nButtonBar.ButtonData.CANCEL_CLOSE));\r\nOptional<ButtonType> result = alert.showAndWait();\r\n// Decide what to do according to the button selected\r\nif (result.get() == buttons[0])\r\n{ System.out.println(\"That is so great to know!\"); }\r\nelse if (result.get() == buttons[1]) {System.out.println(\"You make us happy.\"); }\r\nelse if (result.get() == buttons[2]) { System.out.println(\"We are glad you are\r\npleased.\"); }\r\nelse if (result.get() == buttons[3]) { System.out.println(\"Uh oh ... sounds like\r\nwe need to improve.\"); }\r\nelse if (result.get() == buttons[4]) { System.out.println(\"Oh no! Please explain\r\nwhy.\"); }\r\n10\r\n• There is a limit to how many buttons would fit nicely on the window, but this gives you an idea.\r\n• In addition to the Alert class, there is a ChoiceDialog class that allows the user to have a list of choices\r\nspecified in a drop-down list as follows:\r\n• To do this, we need to specify options again and set them in the constructor:\r\nString[] options = {\"Apple\", \"Orange\", \"Strawberry\", \"Banana\", \"Peaches\"};\r\nChoiceDialog<String> dialog = new ChoiceDialog<String>(\"Peaches\", options);\r\ndialog.setTitle(\"Fruit Information\"); dialog.setHeaderText(null);\r\ndialog.setContentText(\"Choose your favorite fruit\");\r\nOptional<String> result = dialog.showAndWait();\r\nif (result.isPresent()){\r\nSystem.out.println(\"Your choice: \" + result.get()); }\r\n11\r\n• Notice that we can also set the default value (i.e., \"Peaches\" in this case) within the constructor.\r\n• The isPresent() method allows us to determine whether or not the user selected an item or pressed\r\nCANCEL.\r\n• If he/she did not press CANCEL, then we use the get() method to get the value that was selected.\r\n• We can also create a TextInputDialog which will allow the user to enter text from a simple text field:\r\n• The code to create the box is intuitive:\r\nTextInputDialog dialog = new TextInputDialog(\"Mark\");\r\ndialog.setTitle(\"Input Required\"); dialog.setHeaderText(null);\r\ndialog.setContentText(\"Please enter your name:\");\r\nOptional<String> result = dialog.showAndWait();\r\nif (result.isPresent()){\r\nSystem.out.println(\"Your name is: \" + result.get()); }\r\n12\r\nAs a final dialog box, let's customize one that will allow a Username and Password to be entered. To make a\r\ngeneral dialog box, we use the Dialog class:\r\nDialog dialog = new Dialog();\r\ndialog.setTitle(\"Login Dialog\");\r\ndialog.setHeaderText(null);\r\nButtonType loginButtonType = new ButtonType(\"Login\",\r\nButtonBar.ButtonData.OK_DONE);\r\ndialog.getDialogPane().getButtonTypes().addAll(loginButtonType,\r\nButtonType.CANCEL);\r\n• This is a basic dialog box with a Login and Cancel button. You can change the \"Login\" to \"Ok\" for a more\r\ngeneral dialog box.\r\n13\r\n• Now we can add a username and password field. We can create a GridPane to hold it all:\r\n• Here is the code to do this:\r\nGridPane grid = new GridPane();\r\ngrid.setHgap(10); grid.setVgap(10);\r\ngrid.setPadding(new Insets(10, 10, 10, 10));\r\nTextField username = new TextField(); username.setPromptText(\"Username\");\r\nPasswordField password = new PasswordField();\r\npassword.setPromptText(\"Password\");\r\ngrid.add(new Label(\"Username:\"), 0, 0); grid.add(username, 1, 0);\r\ngrid.add(new Label(\"Password:\"), 0, 1); grid.add(password, 1, 1);\r\ndialog.getDialogPane().setContent(grid);\r\n14\r\n• Notice that there is a PasswordField object. This is just a TextField, but it hides the characters that the user\r\ntypes by replacing them with * characters for privacy.\r\n• Finally, we can get open the dialog box and grab the results as follows:\r\nOptional result = dialog.showAndWait();\r\nif (result.isPresent()) {\r\nSystem.out.println(\"Username = \" + username.getText() + \", Password = \"\r\n+ password.getText());\r\n}\r\n• This code accesses the username and password fields directly.\r\n• This works because we are writing all of this code in one spot.\r\n• However, if we created the dialog box elsewhere and we wanted to use it in various locations, we would not\r\nbe able to access the username and password fields directly.\r\n• In this case, we would need to adjust the return value of the Dialog box so that it contains the information\r\nthat we need.\r\n15\r\n• Notice that there is a PasswordField object. This is just a TextField, but it hides the characters that the user\r\ntypes by replacing them with * characters for privacy.\r\n• Finally, we can get open the dialog box and grab the results as follows:\r\nOptional result = dialog.showAndWait();\r\nif (result.isPresent()) {\r\nSystem.out.println(\"Username = \" + username.getText() + \", Password = \"\r\n+ password.getText());\r\n}\r\n• This code accesses the username and password fields directly.\r\n• This works because we are writing all of this code in one spot.\r\n• However, if we created the dialog box elsewhere and we wanted to use it in various locations, we would not\r\nbe able to access the username and password fields directly.\r\n• In this case, we would need to adjust the return value of the Dialog box so that it contains the information\r\nthat we need.\r\n16\r\n• We can replace the above code with this code:\r\n// Convert the result to a Pair containing the username and password\r\ndialog.setResultConverter( new Callback<ButtonType, Pair<String, String>>()\r\n{\r\npublic Pair<String, String> call(ButtonType b) {\r\nif (b == loginButtonType) { return new\r\nPair<String,String>(username.getText(),\r\npassword.getText());\r\n}\r\nreturn null;\r\n}\r\n});\r\nOptional<Pair<String, String>> result = dialog.showAndWait();\r\nif (result.isPresent()) System.out.println(\"Username = \" +\r\nresult.get().getKey() + \", Password = \" + result.get().getValue());\r\n• Notice how we define a Callback (i.e., event handler) by using the setResultConverter() method.\r\n• This allows us to define what will be returned.\r\n• It has a return type of Pair<String, String>.\r\n• This is simply a pair of strings.\r\n17\r\n• The code inside the callback sets the pair to be the username and password that was entered, as long as the\r\nLOGIN button was pressed.\r\n• If CANCEL was pressed, or the window was closed, the result will be null.\r\n• We then access this pair by calling get() and then we can use getKey() and getValue() to go inside the pair\r\nto get the username and password values.\r\n• There are other minor adjustments that we can make. For example, we could have the dialog box come up\r\nwith the focus in the username field:\r\nusername.requestFocus();\r\n• This allows the user to start typing right away when the dialog box first opens instead of having to click on\r\nthe username field to start typing. It is not necessary, but it is convenient.\r\n18\r\n• We can also disable the LOGIN field unless the user has typed in something:\r\n// Enable/Disable login btn depending on whether username was entered.\r\nNode loginButton = dialog.getDialogPane(). lookupButton(loginButtonType);\r\nloginButton.setDisable(true); // Disable upon start\r\nusername.textProperty().addListener(new ChangeListener() {\r\npublic void changed(ObservableValue observable, Object oldValue,\r\nObject newValue) {\r\nloginButton.setDisable(((String)newValue).trim().isEmpty());\r\n}\r\n});\r\n• Now we have a nice username/password field dialog box. True, it is not a \"standard\" dialog box since we\r\nhave customized it, but it is a type of dialog box that is commonly used.\r\n19\r\nFile Chooser Dialog Box\r\n• There is another useful standard dialog\r\nbox in JAVA that is used for selecting files.\r\nIt is called a FileChooser.\r\n• It allows you to browse around various\r\ndirectories and choose a file to open. A\r\nsimilar dialog box is used for choosing a\r\nfile to save (in that case the difference is\r\nthat the Open button is labelled as Save\r\ninstead).\r\n20\r\n• The code brings up the appropriate Open or Save dialog box and then waits for the user to select a file name. It\r\nthen displays the file name and the full path of the file.\r\npublic class FileChooserTestProgram extends Application {\r\nprivate MenuItem openItem, saveItem;\r\npublic void start(Stage primaryStage) {\r\nVBox p = new VBox();\r\nScene scene = new Scene(p, 300, 100); // Set window size\r\n// Create the File menu\r\nMenu fileMenu = new Menu(\"_File\");\r\nopenItem = new MenuItem(\"Open\");\r\nopenItem.setAccelerator(KeyCombination.keyCombination(\"Ctrl+O\"));\r\nsaveItem = new MenuItem(\"Save\");\r\nsaveItem.setAccelerator(KeyCombination.keyCombination(\"Ctrl+S\"));\r\nfileMenu.getItems().addAll(openItem, saveItem);\r\nopenItem.setOnAction(new EventHandler<ActionEvent>() {\r\npublic void handle(ActionEvent e) {\r\nFileChooser chooser = new FileChooser();\r\nchooser.setTitle(\"Open Data File\");\r\nFile f = chooser.showOpenDialog(primaryStage);\r\nif (f != null) {\r\nSystem.out.println(\"File chosen to open: \" + f.getName());\r\nSystem.out.println(\"File with full path: \" +\r\nf.getAbsolutePath());\r\n}\r\n}\r\n}); 21\r\nsaveItem.setOnAction(new EventHandler<ActionEvent>() {\r\npublic void handle(ActionEvent e) {\r\nFileChooser chooser = new FileChooser();\r\nchooser.setTitle(\"Save Data File\");\r\nFile f = chooser.showSaveDialog(primaryStage);\r\nif (f != null) {\r\nSystem.out.println(\"File chosen to save as: \" +\r\nf.getName());\r\nSystem.out.println(\"File with full path: \" +\r\nf.getAbsolutePath());\r\n}\r\n}\r\n});\r\n// Add the menu to a menubar and then add the menubar to the pane\r\nMenuBar menuBar = new MenuBar();\r\nmenuBar.getMenus().addAll(fileMenu);\r\np.getChildren().add(menuBar);\r\nprimaryStage.setTitle(\"File Chooser Test\");\r\nprimaryStage.setScene(scene);\r\nprimaryStage.show();\r\n}\r\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\r\nlaunch(args);\r\n}\r\n}\r\n22\r\n• Notice that we simply open the \"Open\" file dialog box as follows:\r\nFileChooser chooser = new FileChooser();\r\nFile f = chooser.showOpenDialog(primaryStage);\r\n• We open the \"Save\" file dialog box similarly, but by using a different method name:\r\nFileChooser chooser = new FileChooser();\r\nFile f = chooser.showSaveDialog(primaryStage);\r\n• In either case, the dialog box returns a File object (more on this later).\r\n• We can extract the file's name and its full path name by using getName() or getAbsolutePath(), which both return\r\nString objects.\r\n• There are other settings that you can apply to the FileChooser dialog box.\r\n• For example, you could have it open up in a particular directory by adding this before opening the chooser:\r\nchooser.setInitialDirectory(new File(\"C:\\\\\"));\r\n• You can insert any string representing a file folder/directory.\r\n• You can even use System.getProperty(...) to get information from the system such as HOME-related system\r\nvariables.\r\n• You can also specify various file filters so that only certain types of files are shown:\r\nchooser.getExtensionFilters().addAll(\r\nnew FileChooser.ExtensionFilter(\"All Files\", \"*.*\"),\r\nnew FileChooser.ExtensionFilter(\"JPG\", \"*.jpg\"),\r\nnew FileChooser.ExtensionFilter(\"PNG\", \"*.png\") );\r\n• The above code allows either All Files, or just JPG and PNG files to be displayed or selected.\r\n23\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n The questions shouldnt be numbered, \r\n  The quiz should be in this JSON format:\r\n\r\n  {\r\n    \"quizTitle\": STRING,\r\n    \"questions\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"questionTitle\": \"\",\r\n        \"correct_answer\": \"\",\r\n        \"incorrect_answers\": []\r\n      },\r\n      ...\r\n    ]\r\n  }"

If set to null, then no layout\r\nmanager is used.\r\nFlowPane\r\n• The simplest layout pane is the FlowPane.\r\n• It is commonly used to arrange just a few\r\ncomponents on a pane.\r\n• With this pane, components (e.g., buttons, text\r\nfields, etc..) are arranged horizontally from left\r\nto right ... like lines of words in a paragraph\r\nwritten in English.\r\n• If no space remains on the current line,\r\ncomponents flow (or wrap around) to the next\r\n\"line\".\r\n• The height of each line is the maximum height\r\nof any component on that line.\r\n• By default, components are centered\r\nhorizontally on each line, but this can be\r\nchanged.\r\nimport javafx.application.Application;\r\nimport javafx.scene.Scene;\r\nimport javafx.scene.control.Button;\r\nimport javafx.scene.layout.FlowPane;\r\nimport javafx.stage.Stage;\r\nimport javafx.scene.image.*;\r\npublic class FlowPaneExample extends Application {\r\npublic void start(Stage primaryStage) {\r\nFlowPane aPane = new FlowPane();\r\naPane.getChildren().add(new Button(\"one\"));\r\naPane.getChildren().add(new Button(\"two\"));\r\naPane.getChildren().add(new Button(\"three\"));\r\naPane.getChildren().add(new Button(\"Play\", new ImageView(\r\nnew Image(getClass().getResourceAsStream(\"GreenButton.jpg\")))));\r\naPane.getChildren().add(new Button(\"Stop\", new ImageView(\r\nnew Image(getClass().getResourceAsStream(\"RedButton.jpg\")))));\r\nButton b = new Button();\r\nb.setGraphic(new ImageView( new\r\nImage(getClass().getResourceAsStream(\"Progress.gif\"))));\r\naPane.getChildren().add(b);\r\nprimaryStage.setTitle(\"Flow Pane Example\");\r\nprimaryStage.setScene(new Scene(aPane, 500,100));\r\nprimaryStage.show();\r\n}\r\npublic static void main(String[] args) { launch(args); }\r\n}\r\nResults of the previous slide code with different size’s\r\n• We can also specify spacing between components as well as\r\nspacing around the pane's border.\r\n• For example, we can use setVgap() to specify the vertical gap that\r\nwe want to leave between each row of components as the\r\ncomponents wrap around\r\naPane.setVgap(0); aPane.setVgap(10); aPane.setVgap(30);\r\n• We can also use setHgap() to specify the horizontal gap that we want to leave between each\r\ncolumn of components\r\nResults of the previous slide code with different size’s\r\naPane.setHgap(0); aPane.setHgap(30);\r\n• Lastly, we can specify the margins around the border of the\r\nframe by using setPadding() as follows:\r\naPane.setPadding(new Insets(20, 10, 30, 40));\r\n• This will set the margin to be 20 pixels on the top, 10 pixels on\r\nthe right, 30 pixels on the bottom and 40 pixels on the left.\r\n• However, since our pane is by itself in the window, only the\r\ntop and left settings make sense in this application.\r\n• In the case where we want the same margin on the top, right,\r\nbottom and left sides, we can use this simpler constructor\r\ninstead:\r\naPane.setPadding(new Insets(25));\r\nwhich will set the margin to 25 on all 4 sides\r\naPane.setPadding(new Insets(25,0,0,25));\r\nHBox/ VBox\r\n• The HBox and VBox layouts are also very simple to use.\r\n• It is similar to the FlowPane in that it arranges components one after\r\nanother, either horizontally or vertically.\r\n• It does not have a wrap-around effect.\r\n• Any components that do not fit on the line are simply not shown.\r\n• If we want to lay the components out horizontally, we use\r\nnew HBox()\r\nas our pane.\r\n• To lay the components out vertically, we use\r\nnew VBox()\r\nimport javafx.application.Application;\r\nimport javafx.scene.Scene;\r\nimport javafx.scene.control.Button;\r\nimport javafx.scene.layout.HBox;\r\nimport javafx.stage.Stage;\r\nimport javafx.scene.image.*;\r\npublic class HBoxExample extends Application {\r\npublic void start(Stage primaryStage) {\r\nHBox aPane = new HBox();\r\naPane.getChildren().add(new Button(\"one\"));\r\naPane.getChildren().add(new Button(\"two\"));\r\naPane.getChildren().add(new Button(\"three\"));\r\naPane.getChildren().add(new Button(\"Play\", new ImageView(\r\nnew Image(getClass()\r\n.getResourceAsStream(\"GreenButton.jpg\")))));\r\naPane.getChildren().add(new Button(\"Stop\", new ImageView(\r\nnew Image(getClass()\r\n.getResourceAsStream(\"RedButton.jpg\")))));\r\nButton b = new Button();\r\nb.setGraphic(new ImageView( new Image(getClass()\r\n.getResourceAsStream( \"Progress.gif\"))));\r\naPane.getChildren().add(b);\r\nprimaryStage.setTitle(\"HBox Example\");\r\nprimaryStage.setScene(new Scene(aPane, 500,100));\r\nprimaryStage.show();\r\n}\r\npublic static void main(String[] args) { launch(args);

We then number the columns and rows, starting at 0 at the top left.\r\n• This will be the basis for laying out the components.\r\n• We can lay out all the components by specifying the grid location (i.e., column and\r\nrow) that each component lies in when we add it to the pane\r\nGridPane aPane = new GridPane();\r\nTextField newItemField = new TextField();\r\naPane.add(newItemField,0,0);\r\nButton addButton = new Button(\"Add\");\r\naPane.add(addButton,1,0);\r\nListView<String> fruitList = new ListView<String>();\r\naPane.add(fruitList,0,1);\r\nButton removeButton = new Button(\"Remove\");\r\naPane.add(removeButton,1,1);\r\n• we need to move the Remove button up, make the buttons the same size and\r\nadd some spacing.\r\n• Currently, the Remove button is centered vertically. We can change this by using:\r\naPane.setValignment(removeButton, VPos.TOP);\r\n• The setValignment() allows us to set the alignment of a component to\r\nVPos.TOP, VPos.BOTTOM, or VPos.CENTER.\r\nHere is the result -------------------------------->\r\n• Now, we need to make the buttons the same size.\r\n• The simplest way to do this is to specify the width and height that we want the\r\nbuttons to have.\r\n• We can make the buttons 100x30 in size by setting the minimum width and\r\nheight as follows:\r\naddButton.setMinHeight(30); addButton.setMinWidth(100);\r\nremoveButton.setMinHeight(30);\r\nremoveButton.setMinWidth(100);\r\n• We will also set the TextField to have the same height as the buttons:\r\nnewItemField.setMinHeight(30);\r\n• The window does not resize properly as shown here on the right.\r\n• When the window is enlarged, the components do not grow properly to take\r\nup the extra window space.\r\n• We fix this by simply specifying that we want the fruitList to be as large as\r\npossible to take up all that extra space.\r\n• To do this, we simply set the preferred width and height to the largest\r\npossible values:\r\nfruitList.setPrefWidth(Integer.MAX_VALUE);\r\nfruitList.setPrefHeight(Integer.MAX_VALUE);\r\n• Now the list resizes nicely when the window grows as shown here on the\r\nright --------------------------------------->\r\n• The last thing to do is to adjust the spacing around the components. We can\r\nuse the setMargin() method for our components as follows:\r\naPane.setMargin(newItemField, new Insets(0, 0, 10, 0));\r\naPane.setMargin(addButton, new Insets(0, 0, 10, 10));\r\naPane.setMargin(removeButton, new Insets(0, 0, 0, 10));\r\nComplete Code\r\nimport javafx.application.Application; import javafx.collections.FXCollections;\r\nimport javafx.geometry.*; import javafx.scene.Scene;\r\nimport javafx.scene.control.*; import javafx.scene.layout.GridPane;\r\nimport javafx.stage.Stage;\r\npublic class MoreComplicatedGridPaneExample extends Application {\r\npublic void start(Stage primaryStage) {\r\nGridPane aPane = new GridPane();\r\naPane.setPadding(new Insets(10, 10, 10, 10));\r\nTextField newItemField = new TextField();\r\nnewItemField.setMinHeight(30); aPane.add(newItemField,0,0);\r\naPane.setMargin(newItemField, new Insets(0, 0, 10, 0));\r\nButton addButton = new Button(\"Add\"); aPane.add(addButton,1,0);\r\naddButton.setMinHeight(30); addButton.setMinWidth(100);\r\naPane.setMargin(addButton, new Insets(0, 0, 10, 10));\r\nListView<String> fruitList = new ListView<String>();\r\nString[] fruits = {\"Apples\", \"Oranges\", \"Bananas\", \"Cherries\",\r\n\"Lemons\", \"Pears\", \"Strawberries\", \"Peaches\", \"Pomegranates\",\r\n\"Nectarines\", \"Apricots\"};\r\nComplete Code\r\nfruitList.setItems(FXCollections.observableArrayList(fruits));\r\nfruitList.setPrefWidth(Integer.MAX_VALUE);\r\nfruitList.setPrefHeight(Integer.MAX_VALUE);\r\naPane.add(fruitList,0,1);\r\nButton removeButton = new Button(\"Remove\");\r\naPane.add(removeButton,1,1);\r\nremoveButton.setMinHeight(30);\r\nremoveButton.setMinWidth(100);\r\naPane.setMargin(removeButton, new Insets(0, 0, 0, 10));\r\naPane.setValignment(removeButton, VPos.TOP);\r\nprimaryStage.setTitle(\"More Complicated GridPane Example\");\r\nprimaryStage.setScene(new Scene(aPane, 420,320));\r\nprimaryStage.show();\r\n}\r\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\r\nlaunch(args);\r\n}\r\n}"

If set to null, then no layout\r\nmanager is used.\r\nFlowPane\r\n• The simplest layout pane is the FlowPane.\r\n• It is commonly used to arrange just a few\r\ncomponents on a pane.\r\n• With this pane, components (e.g., buttons, text\r\nfields, etc..) are arranged horizontally from left\r\nto right ... like lines of words in a paragraph\r\nwritten in English.\r\n• If no space remains on the current line,\r\ncomponents flow (or wrap around) to the next\r\n\"line\".\r\n• The height of each line is the maximum height\r\nof any component on that line.\r\n• By default, components are centered\r\nhorizontally on each line, but this can be\r\nchanged.\r\nimport javafx.application.Application;\r\nimport javafx.scene.Scene;\r\nimport javafx.scene.control.Button;\r\nimport javafx.scene.layout.FlowPane;\r\nimport javafx.stage.Stage;\r\nimport javafx.scene.image.*;\r\npublic class FlowPaneExample extends Application {\r\npublic void start(Stage primaryStage) {\r\nFlowPane aPane = new FlowPane();\r\naPane.getChildren().add(new Button(\"one\"));\r\naPane.getChildren().add(new Button(\"two\"));\r\naPane.getChildren().add(new Button(\"three\"));\r\naPane.getChildren().add(new Button(\"Play\", new ImageView(\r\nnew Image(getClass().getResourceAsStream(\"GreenButton.jpg\")))));\r\naPane.getChildren().add(new Button(\"Stop\", new ImageView(\r\nnew Image(getClass().getResourceAsStream(\"RedButton.jpg\")))));\r\nButton b = new Button();\r\nb.setGraphic(new ImageView( new\r\nImage(getClass().getResourceAsStream(\"Progress.gif\"))));\r\naPane.getChildren().add(b);\r\nprimaryStage.setTitle(\"Flow Pane Example\");\r\nprimaryStage.setScene(new Scene(aPane, 500,100));\r\nprimaryStage.show();\r\n}\r\npublic static void main(String[] args) { launch(args); }\r\n}\r\nResults of the previous slide code with different size’s\r\n• We can also specify spacing between components as well as\r\nspacing around the pane's border.\r\n• For example, we can use setVgap() to specify the vertical gap that\r\nwe want to leave between each row of components as the\r\ncomponents wrap around\r\naPane.setVgap(0); aPane.setVgap(10); aPane.setVgap(30);\r\n• We can also use setHgap() to specify the horizontal gap that we want to leave between each\r\ncolumn of components\r\nResults of the previous slide code with different size’s\r\naPane.setHgap(0); aPane.setHgap(30);\r\n• Lastly, we can specify the margins around the border of the\r\nframe by using setPadding() as follows:\r\naPane.setPadding(new Insets(20, 10, 30, 40));\r\n• This will set the margin to be 20 pixels on the top, 10 pixels on\r\nthe right, 30 pixels on the bottom and 40 pixels on the left.\r\n• However, since our pane is by itself in the window, only the\r\ntop and left settings make sense in this application.\r\n• In the case where we want the same margin on the top, right,\r\nbottom and left sides, we can use this simpler constructor\r\ninstead:\r\naPane.setPadding(new Insets(25));\r\nwhich will set the margin to 25 on all 4 sides\r\naPane.setPadding(new Insets(25,0,0,25));\r\nHBox/ VBox\r\n• The HBox and VBox layouts are also very simple to use.\r\n• It is similar to the FlowPane in that it arranges components one after\r\nanother, either horizontally or vertically.\r\n• It does not have a wrap-around effect.\r\n• Any components that do not fit on the line are simply not shown.\r\n• If we want to lay the components out horizontally, we use\r\nnew HBox()\r\nas our pane.\r\n• To lay the components out vertically, we use\r\nnew VBox()\r\nimport javafx.application.Application;\r\nimport javafx.scene.Scene;\r\nimport javafx.scene.control.Button;\r\nimport javafx.scene.layout.HBox;\r\nimport javafx.stage.Stage;\r\nimport javafx.scene.image.*;\r\npublic class HBoxExample extends Application {\r\npublic void start(Stage primaryStage) {\r\nHBox aPane = new HBox();\r\naPane.getChildren().add(new Button(\"one\"));\r\naPane.getChildren().add(new Button(\"two\"));\r\naPane.getChildren().add(new Button(\"three\"));\r\naPane.getChildren().add(new Button(\"Play\", new ImageView(\r\nnew Image(getClass()\r\n.getResourceAsStream(\"GreenButton.jpg\")))));\r\naPane.getChildren().add(new Button(\"Stop\", new ImageView(\r\nnew Image(getClass()\r\n.getResourceAsStream(\"RedButton.jpg\")))));\r\nButton b = new Button();\r\nb.setGraphic(new ImageView( new Image(getClass()\r\n.getResourceAsStream( \"Progress.gif\"))));\r\naPane.getChildren().add(b);\r\nprimaryStage.setTitle(\"HBox Example\");\r\nprimaryStage.setScene(new Scene(aPane, 500,100));\r\nprimaryStage.show();\r\n}\r\npublic static void main(String[] args) { launch(args);

We then number the columns and rows, starting at 0 at the top left.\r\n• This will be the basis for laying out the components.\r\n• We can lay out all the components by specifying the grid location (i.e., column and\r\nrow) that each component lies in when we add it to the pane\r\nGridPane aPane = new GridPane();\r\nTextField newItemField = new TextField();\r\naPane.add(newItemField,0,0);\r\nButton addButton = new Button(\"Add\");\r\naPane.add(addButton,1,0);\r\nListView<String> fruitList = new ListView<String>();\r\naPane.add(fruitList,0,1);\r\nButton removeButton = new Button(\"Remove\");\r\naPane.add(removeButton,1,1);\r\n• we need to move the Remove button up, make the buttons the same size and\r\nadd some spacing.\r\n• Currently, the Remove button is centered vertically. We can change this by using:\r\naPane.setValignment(removeButton, VPos.TOP);\r\n• The setValignment() allows us to set the alignment of a component to\r\nVPos.TOP, VPos.BOTTOM, or VPos.CENTER.\r\nHere is the result -------------------------------->\r\n• Now, we need to make the buttons the same size.\r\n• The simplest way to do this is to specify the width and height that we want the\r\nbuttons to have.\r\n• We can make the buttons 100x30 in size by setting the minimum width and\r\nheight as follows:\r\naddButton.setMinHeight(30); addButton.setMinWidth(100);\r\nremoveButton.setMinHeight(30);\r\nremoveButton.setMinWidth(100);\r\n• We will also set the TextField to have the same height as the buttons:\r\nnewItemField.setMinHeight(30);\r\n• The window does not resize properly as shown here on the right.\r\n• When the window is enlarged, the components do not grow properly to take\r\nup the extra window space.\r\n• We fix this by simply specifying that we want the fruitList to be as large as\r\npossible to take up all that extra space.\r\n• To do this, we simply set the preferred width and height to the largest\r\npossible values:\r\nfruitList.setPrefWidth(Integer.MAX_VALUE);\r\nfruitList.setPrefHeight(Integer.MAX_VALUE);\r\n• Now the list resizes nicely when the window grows as shown here on the\r\nright --------------------------------------->\r\n• The last thing to do is to adjust the spacing around the components. We can\r\nuse the setMargin() method for our components as follows:\r\naPane.setMargin(newItemField, new Insets(0, 0, 10, 0));\r\naPane.setMargin(addButton, new Insets(0, 0, 10, 10));\r\naPane.setMargin(removeButton, new Insets(0, 0, 0, 10));\r\nComplete Code\r\nimport javafx.application.Application; import javafx.collections.FXCollections;\r\nimport javafx.geometry.*; import javafx.scene.Scene;\r\nimport javafx.scene.control.*; import javafx.scene.layout.GridPane;\r\nimport javafx.stage.Stage;\r\npublic class MoreComplicatedGridPaneExample extends Application {\r\npublic void start(Stage primaryStage) {\r\nGridPane aPane = new GridPane();\r\naPane.setPadding(new Insets(10, 10, 10, 10));\r\nTextField newItemField = new TextField();\r\nnewItemField.setMinHeight(30); aPane.add(newItemField,0,0);\r\naPane.setMargin(newItemField, new Insets(0, 0, 10, 0));\r\nButton addButton = new Button(\"Add\"); aPane.add(addButton,1,0);\r\naddButton.setMinHeight(30); addButton.setMinWidth(100);\r\naPane.setMargin(addButton, new Insets(0, 0, 10, 10));\r\nListView<String> fruitList = new ListView<String>();\r\nString[] fruits = {\"Apples\", \"Oranges\", \"Bananas\", \"Cherries\",\r\n\"Lemons\", \"Pears\", \"Strawberries\", \"Peaches\", \"Pomegranates\",\r\n\"Nectarines\", \"Apricots\"};\r\nComplete Code\r\nfruitList.setItems(FXCollections.observableArrayList(fruits));\r\nfruitList.setPrefWidth(Integer.MAX_VALUE);\r\nfruitList.setPrefHeight(Integer.MAX_VALUE);\r\naPane.add(fruitList,0,1);\r\nButton removeButton = new Button(\"Remove\");\r\naPane.add(removeButton,1,1);\r\nremoveButton.setMinHeight(30);\r\nremoveButton.setMinWidth(100);\r\naPane.setMargin(removeButton, new Insets(0, 0, 0, 10));\r\naPane.setValignment(removeButton, VPos.TOP);\r\nprimaryStage.setTitle(\"More Complicated GridPane Example\");\r\nprimaryStage.setScene(new Scene(aPane, 420,320));\r\nprimaryStage.show();\r\n}\r\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\r\nlaunch(args);\r\n}\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n The questions shouldnt be numbered, \r\n  The quiz should be in this JSON format:\r\n\r\n  {\r\n    \"quizTitle\": STRING,\r\n    \"questions\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"questionTitle\": \"\",\r\n        \"correct_answer\": \"\",\r\n        \"incorrect_answers\": []\r\n      },\r\n      ...\r\n    ]\r\n  }"

So we should add this method to the controller (i.e., the main\r\napplication):\r\n// The Add Button event handler\r\nprivate void handleAddButtonPress() {\r\nmodel.add(view.getNewItemField().getText());\r\nview.update();\r\n}\r\n• Notice that this method is private, since no external classes should be calling it. The code does two\r\nmain things that ALL of your event handlers should do:\r\n• Change the Model\r\n• Update the View\r\n6\r\n• Now, we need to \"plug it in\" to the Button.\r\n• We will need to add an EventHandler<ActionEvent> to the button.\r\n//code for controller’s constructor\r\nview.getAddButton().setOnAction(new EventHandler<ActionEvent>() {\r\npublic void handle(ActionEvent actionEvent) {\r\nhandleAddButtonPress();\r\n}\r\n});\r\n• Notice how the Button is accessed from the view. The code hooks up to the event handler method\r\nthat we just wrote. The code should now work and allow new items to be added to the list.\r\n• However, a slight problem occurs when the user does not have anything typed into the text field and\r\nthen presses the Add button.\r\n• A \"blank\" item is added to the list. This is not pleasant.\r\n7\r\n• We can ensure that no blank items are added by altering our code a little:\r\nprivate void handleAddButtonPress() {\r\nString text = view.getNewItemField().getText().trim();\r\nif (text.length() > 0) {\r\nmodel.add(text);\r\nview.update();\r\n}\r\n}\r\n• You may have noticed the trim() method added here.\r\n• This is a String method that removes any leading and trailing space and tab characters.\r\n• That will ensure that we do not add any items consisting of only spaces or tab characters.\r\nRemoving Items\r\n8\r\n• Similarly, to remove an item from the Grocery List, we will require the user to select the item from the list\r\nand then press the Remove button.\r\n• Let us write an event handler for when the Remove button is pressed.\r\n• It will need to get the index of the selected item from the list and call the model's remove() method using this\r\nindex. Then the view should be updated.\r\n• To get the selected item from the list, we can look in the JAVA API and determine that the ListView\r\nmethod we need to call is getSelectionModel().getSelectedIndex().\r\n• This will return -1 if nothing is selected, so we should handle that.\r\n• So we should add this method to the controller (i.e., the main application):\r\n// The Remove Button event handler\r\nprivate void handleRemoveButtonPress() {\r\nint index = view.getList().getSelectionModel().getSelectedIndex();\r\nif (index >= 0) {\r\nmodel.remove(index);\r\nview.update();\r\n}\r\n}\r\nRemoving Items\r\n9\r\n// Add the following to controller’s constructor\r\nview.getRemoveButton().setOnAction(new EventHandler<ActionEvent>() {\r\npublic void handle(ActionEvent actionEvent) {\r\nhandleRemoveButtonPress();\r\n}\r\n});\r\n• This completes the basic functionalities for the code.\r\nExtra’s : Disabling the remove button\r\n10\r\n• It would be a good idea to disable the Remove button when nothing has\r\nbeen selected in the list.\r\n• That way the user knows visually that the Remove operation is not valid until\r\nsomething is selected.\r\n• It is a good form of feedback to the user and it makes the user interface more\r\nintuitive to use.\r\n• Since this is simply a visual change, we could simply add a line to the update()\r\nmethod in the view class.\r\nExtra’s : Disabling the remove button\r\npublic void update() {\r\n// Create and return a new array with the\r\n// exact size of the number of items in it\r\nString[] exactList = new String[model.getSize()];\r\nfor (int i=0; i<model.getSize(); i++)\r\nexactList[i] = model.getItems()[i];\r\ngroceryList.setItems(FXCollections.observableArrayLi\r\nst(exactList));\r\n// enable/disable the remove button accordingly\r\nremoveButton.setDisable(groceryList\r\n.getSelectionModel()\r\n.getSelectedIndex() <0);\r\n}\r\n11\r\nExtra’s : Disabling the remove button\r\n12\r\n• Logically, this code will disable the button if the selected index in the list is -1\r\n(i.e., when nothing is selected).\r\n• If we start up the application, the Remove button will be disabled properly\r\nsince likely, nothing has been selected in the list.\r\n• When should it be re-enabled ?\r\n• According to our update() method, whenever something is selected from the list it will be\r\nenabled.\r\n• However, we need to ensure that the update() method is called when the user\r\nselects something from the list.\r\n• Whenever the user clicks in the list, we can simply update the view to ensure\r\nthat the Remove button is re-enabled.\r\n• Here is the simple event handler to put into the controller class\r\n// The ListView selection event handler\r\nprivate void handleListSelection() { view.update(); }\r\nExtra’s : Disabling the remove button\r\n13\r\n• There are a few ways to cause this to occur. The simplest is to add a mousePressed event\r\nhandler to the ListView. Again, we plug it in by adding this to the constructor:\r\nview.getList().setOnMousePressed(new EventHandler<MouseEvent>() {\r\npublic void handle(MouseEvent mouseEvent) {\r\nhandleListSelection();\r\n}\r\n});\r\n• However, a minor issue arises in that when we update the list by repopulating its contents, the\r\ncurrently selected item becomes unselected.\r\n• We can fix this by remembering what is selected before we update the list and then re-select\r\nthat item again afterwards.\r\n• In the view, we can alter the update() method to do this:\r\nExtra’s : Disabling the remove button\r\n14\r\npublic void update() {\r\n// Create and return a new array with the\r\n// exact size of the number of items in it\r\nString[] exactList = new String[model.getSize()];\r\nfor (int i=0; i<model.getSize(); i++)\r\nexactList[i] = model.getItems()[i];\r\nint selectedIndex = groceryList.getSelectionModel()\r\n.getSelectedIndex();\r\ngroceryList.setItems(FXCollections.observableArrayList(exactList));\r\ngroceryList.getSelectionModel().select(selectedIndex); //\r\nenable/disable the remove button accordingly\r\nremoveButton.setDisable(groceryList\r\n.getSelectionModel()\r\n.getSelectedIndex() <0);\r\n}\r\nExtra’s : Disabling the Add button\r\n15\r\n• Finally, it would also be a good idea to disable the Add button when nothing is typed in the text field.\r\n• To do this, we need to add a single line to the update() method in the view that is similar to the one we\r\nadded to enable/disable the Remove button. However, this time we look at the text in the text field:\r\npublic void update() {\r\n// ...\r\n// enable/disable the Add button accordingly\r\naddButton.setDisable(newItemField.getText().trim().length() <= 0);\r\n}\r\nExtra’s : Disabling the Add button\r\n16\r\n• Of course, once again we need to have the button re-enabled when the user\r\nstarts typing into the text field.\r\n• We need an event that occurs when the user types into a text field. Again the\r\nevent handler is simple:\r\n// The TextField typing event handler\r\nprivate void handleTextEntry() { view.update(); }\r\n• As with the ListView selection event handling, there are a few ways to plug in the event handler\r\nfor the TextField.\r\n• The simplest way is to handle a KeyReleased event\r\nExtra’s : Disabling the Add button\r\n17\r\n• So, whenever the user types a character into the text field (i.e., a character or delete, or ENTER,\r\netc...), then the event will be called.\r\n• However, take note that it will not be called if the user cuts or pastes something into the text\r\nfield via a mouse operation.\r\n• Also, a KeyPressed event will not work here because it will generate the event before the typed\r\ncharacter is part of the text field's data, so we will always be missing one character when\r\nchecking the length of the String.\r\n• A KeyReleased event will be generated AFTER the character has been added to the text field,\r\nso this is fine.\r\nview.getNewItemField().setOnKeyReleased(new EventHandler<KeyEvent>() {\r\npublic void handle(KeyEvent keyEvent) {\r\nhandleTextEntry();\r\n}\r\n});\r\nExtra’s : Clearing the Text Field\r\n18\r\n• One final alteration to the program would be to clear the text field after an item has been\r\nadded.\r\n• Otherwise, after each item has been added, the user will have to delete the text before adding\r\nthe next item. This can be tedious.\r\n• To accomplish this, we simply add one more line to the Add button event handler to clear the\r\ntext:\r\nprivate void handleAddButtonPress() {\r\nString text = view.getNewItemField().getText().trim();\r\nif (text.length() > 0) {\r\nview.getNewItemField().setText(\"\");\r\nmodel.add(text);\r\nview.update();\r\n}\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n The questions shouldnt be numbered, \r\n  The quiz should be in this JSON format:\r\n\r\n  {\r\n    \"quizTitle\": STRING,\r\n    \"questions\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"questionTitle\": \"\",\r\n        \"correct_answer\": \"\",\r\n        \"incorrect_answers\": []\r\n      },\r\n      ...\r\n    ]\r\n  }"

In general, there may\r\nbe many views in an application, just as\r\nthere may be many models and\r\ncontrollers.\r\n• For this example, we are only considering\r\nhaving one view.\r\n• To keep things simple, we will develop\r\nour views as Pane objects that can be\r\nplaced onto our Application windows.\r\n4\r\n5\r\nimport javafx.collections.FXCollections;\r\nimport javafx.scene.control.*;\r\nimport javafx.scene.layout.Pane;\r\npublic class GroceryListView extends Pane {\r\npublic GroceryListView() {\r\n// Create and position the \"new item\" TextField\r\nTextField newItemField = new TextField();\r\nnewItemField.relocate(10, 10); newItemField.setPrefSize(150, 25);\r\n// Create and position the \"Add\" Button\r\nButton addButton = new Button(\"Add\");\r\naddButton.relocate(175, 10); addButton.setPrefSize(100, 25);\r\n// Create and position the \"Remove\" Button\r\nButton removeButton = new Button(\"Remove\");\r\nremoveButton.relocate(175, 45); removeButton.setPrefSize(100, 25);\r\n6\r\n// Create and position the grocery ListView with some groceries in it\r\nListView<String> groceryList = new ListView<String>();\r\nString[] groceries = {\"Apples\", \"Oranges\", \"Bananas\", \"Toilet Paper\",\r\n\"Ketchup\", \"Cereal\", \"Milk\", \"Cookies\", \"Cheese\", \"Frozen Pizza\"};\r\ngroceryList.setItems(FXCollections.observableArrayList(groceries));\r\ngroceryList.relocate(10, 45);\r\ngroceryList.setPrefSize(150, 150);\r\n// Add all the components to the window\r\ngetChildren().addAll(newItemField, addButton, removeButton,\r\ngroceryList);\r\n}\r\n}\r\n7\r\n• For the purposes of a quick test to make sure that our view is properly formatted, we can create and\r\nrun a simple program like this:\r\nimport javafx.application.Application;\r\nimport javafx.scene.Scene;\r\nimport javafx.stage.Stage;\r\npublic class GroceryListViewTestProgram extends Application {\r\npublic void start(Stage primaryStage) {\r\nGroceryListView myPanel = new GroceryListView();\r\nprimaryStage.setTitle(\"View Test\");\r\nprimaryStage.setResizable(true);\r\nprimaryStage.setScene(new Scene(myPanel, 285,205));\r\nprimaryStage.show();\r\n}\r\npublic static void main(String[] args) { launch(args); }\r\n}\r\n8\r\n• Now, for the view to work properly it must refresh its look based on the most\r\nup-to-date information in the model.\r\n• Therefore, we need a way of having the view update itself given a specific\r\nmodel.\r\n• There are many ways to do this, but a simple way is to write a method called\r\nupdate() that will refresh the \"look\" of the view whenever it is called.\r\n• Of course, to be able to update, the view must have access to the model.\r\n• We can pass the model in as a parameter to the view constructor and store it\r\nas an attribute of the view:\r\npublic class GroceryListView extends Pane {\r\nprivate ItemList model; // The model to which this view is attached\r\npublic GroceryListView(ItemList m) {\r\nmodel = m; // Store the model for access later\r\n...\r\n}\r\n// This method is called whenever the model changes\r\npublic void update() {\r\n// ... code for refreshing the view\r\n}\r\n}\r\n9\r\n• Our update() method may be as simple as replacing the\r\nentire ListView with the new items currently stored in the\r\nmodel.\r\n• So, regardless of what changes take place in the ItemList\r\nmodel, we simply read the list of items and re-populate\r\nthe ListView with the latest items.\r\n• To be able to do this, we will need access to that\r\nListView. However, the ListView is defined as a local\r\nvariable in the constructor.\r\n• In order to be able to access it from the update()\r\nmethod, we will need to define the variable outside of\r\nthe constructor as an instance variable.\r\n• Then, to change the contents of the ListView, a quick\r\nsearch in the JAVA API informs us that there is a\r\nsetItems() method which will allow us to pass in an array\r\nof items to show in the list.\r\n10\r\npublic class GroceryListView extends Pane {\r\nprivate ItemList model; // model to which this view is attached\r\nprivate ListView<String> groceryList; // visible list representing model\r\npublic GroceryListView(ItemList m) {\r\nmodel = m; // Store the model for access later\r\n...\r\ngroceryList = new ListView<String>();\r\n...\r\n}\r\n// This method is called whenever the model changes\r\npublic void update() {\r\ngroceryList.setItems(FXCollections.observableArrayList(\r\nmodel.getItems()));\r\n}\r\n}\r\n11\r\n• Notice how the ListView is now easily accessible in the update() method.\r\n• One problem, however, is that our model's array is always of size 100 regardless of how many items have\r\nbeen placed in it.\r\n• The setItems() method will end up making a list of 100 items in it ... leaving many blanks.\r\n• We can add additional code here to make a new array (for display purposes) which has a length exactly\r\nequal to the size of the items array. Let's, change the update() method to this:\r\n// This method is called whenever the model changes\r\npublic void update() {\r\n// Create and return a new array with the\r\n// exact size of the number of items in it\r\nString[] exactList = new String[model.getSize()];\r\nfor (int i=0; i<model.getSize(); i++)\r\nexactList[i] = model.getItems()[i];\r\ngroceryList.setItems(FXCollections.observableArrayList(exactList));\r\n}\r\n12\r\n• We are aware that eventually the application will need to respond to user input through pressing the Add or\r\nRemove button, typing in the text field or selecting from the list.\r\n• This will be part of the controller.\r\n• However, in order to accomplish this, as you will soon see, we need to allow the controller to access the\r\nButton, ListView and TextField objects.\r\n• We can allow such access by making instance variables for all four window components and then provide\r\nget methods to access them.\r\n• As a final programming aspect of the view class, it is a good idea to call the update() method at the end of\r\nthe constructor. That way, when the view is first created, it can be refreshed right away to show the true state\r\nof the model upon startup.\r\nUpdating our view class\r\n13\r\nimport javafx.collections.FXCollections;\r\nimport javafx.scene.control.*;\r\nimport javafx.scene.layout.Pane;\r\npublic class GroceryListView extends Pane {\r\nprivate ItemList model; // model to which this view is attached\r\n// The user interface components needed by the controller\r\nprivate ListView<String> groceryList;\r\nprivate Button addButton;\r\nprivate Button removeButton;\r\nprivate TextField newItemField; // public methods to allow access to window components\r\npublic ListView<String> getList() { return groceryList; }\r\npublic Button getAddButton() { return addButton; }\r\npublic Button getRemoveButton() { return removeButton; }\r\npublic TextField getNewItemField() { return newItemField; }\r\npublic GroceryListView(ItemList m) { model = m; // Store the model for access later\r\n// Create and position the \"new item\" TextField\r\nnewItemField = new TextField();\r\nnewItemField.relocate(10, 10);\r\nnewItemField.setPrefSize(150, 25);\r\n// Create and position the \"Add\" Button\r\naddButton = new Button(\"Add\");\r\naddButton.relocate(175, 10);\r\naddButton.setPrefSize(100, 25);\r\nUpdating our view class\r\n14\r\n// Create and position the \"Remove\" Button\r\nremoveButton = new Button(\"Remove\");\r\nremoveButton.relocate(175, 45);\r\nremoveButton.setPrefSize(100, 25);\r\n// Create and position the \"fruit\" ListView with some fruits in it\r\ngroceryList = new ListView<String>(); String[] groceries = {\"Apples\", \"Oranges\", \"Bananas\", \"Toilet\r\nPaper\", \"Ketchup\", \"Cereal\", \"Milk\", \"Cookies\", \"Cheese\", \"Frozen Pizza\" };\r\ngroceryList.setItems(FXCollections.observableArrayList(groceries));\r\ngroceryList.relocate(10, 45);\r\ngroceryList.setPrefSize(150, 150);\r\n// Add all the components to the window\r\ngetChildren().addAll(newItemField, addButton, removeButton, groceryList);\r\n// Call update() to make sure model contents are shown\r\nupdate();\r\n}\r\n// This method is called whenever the model changes, to make\r\n// sure that the view shows the model's current state\r\npublic void update() {\r\n// Create and return a new array with the\r\n// exact size of the number of items in it\r\nString[] exactList = new String[model.getSize()];\r\nfor (int i=0; i<model.getSize(); i++)\r\nexactList[i] = model.getItems()[i];\r\ngroceryList.setItems(FXCollections.observableArrayList(exactList));\r\n}\r\n}\r\nUpdating our view test class\r\n15\r\nimport javafx.application.Application;\r\nimport javafx.scene.Scene;\r\nimport javafx.stage.Stage;\r\npublic class GroceryListViewTestProgram2 extends Application {\r\npublic void start(Stage primaryStage) {\r\nItemList groceryList = new ItemList();\r\ngroceryList.add(\"Apples\");\r\ngroceryList.add(\"Toilet Paper\");\r\ngroceryList.add(\"Ketchup\");\r\nGroceryListView myPanel = new GroceryListView(groceryList);\r\nprimaryStage.setTitle(\"View Test\");\r\nprimaryStage.setResizable(true);\r\nprimaryStage.setScene(new Scene(myPanel, 285,205));\r\nprimaryStage.show();\r\n}\r\npublic static void main(String[] args) { launch(args); }\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n The questions shouldnt be numbered, \r\n  The quiz should be in this JSON format:\r\n\r\n  {\r\n    \"quizTitle\": STRING,\r\n    \"questions\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"questionTitle\": \"\",\r\n        \"correct_answer\": \"\",\r\n        \"incorrect_answers\": []\r\n      },\r\n      ...\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n\r\n"
